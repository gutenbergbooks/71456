<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>From the time of the first kisses recorded in the book of
Genesis,—the kiss with which Jacob imposed upon the credulity
of his blind old father and defrauded his brother of the blessing
intended for him, and that of Jacob the lover when he
met Rachel at the well,—to the present hour, the custom of
kissing has been so universally honored in the observance
that one would naturally expect to find in any well-regulated
library a formal treatise upon its manifold phases and expressions.
Yet, with the exception of a few insignificant monographs
of the seventeenth century, the curious inquirer would
find upon the shelves nothing specially devoted to a custom
with which all of human kind, from the elect of the children
of men to the dwellers <i>in partibus infidelium</i>, are familiar.
To borrow a waggish saying, the knowledge of the art has
been principally transmitted from mouth to mouth. Herrenschmidius
published his “Osculogia” in 1630; Muller, “De
Osculo Sancto,” in 1674; and Kempius, “De Osculis,” in
1680. Boberg wrote upon the fashion of kissing among the
Hebrews, and Pfanner upon the kisses of the primitive
Christians,—both in Latin. But works of this character are
inaccessible to general readers. Those modern classics, the
“Basia” of Secundus, and the “Baisers” of Dorat and of
Bonnefons, are readily attainable, both in the original and in
the form of translations and paraphrases.</p>

<p>Beyond this extremely limited range the literature of kissing
is scattered as widely as its practice. For the earlier presentment
of a custom favored in all ages, we must recur to
the Bible. There only may we raise “the barred visor of
antiquity” for full and conclusive revelation; and there shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
we find that the kiss, in all the varied forms of which it is susceptible,
was recognized among ancient kindred, and lovers,
and friends, as an expression of affection or sympathy, as a
symbol of joy or sorrow, as a token of welcome or farewell,
as a mark of reverence, or reconciliation, or gratitude, or humility.
There, likewise, shall we find the kiss of hypocrisy,
as noted in the case of Absalom on the eve of his conspiracy;
the sensual kiss, as referred to in the Proverbs; and the
spiritual kiss, of the Song of Solomon.</p>

<p>In the annals of the later periods of human passions and
activities the records of the custom are more widely diffused.
Since the woman “which was a sinner” washed the feet of the
Master, with tears, wiped them with her hair, and kissed them
so humbly and with such affectionate tenderness, millions of
good Christians have done the same in their hearts. Since
the Emperor Justinian kissed the foot of the sovereign pontiff
Constantine, millions of the faithful in the mother church have
bowed their necks to kiss the embroidered cross on the slipper
of the Pope. Since “the sweet, soft murmur of a kiss of love”
was first heard in the groves and gardens of Judea, “a great
multitude, which no man could number,” have had recourse
to the same token as seal to the indenture of their own loves,
have found in the same attraction another eloquence than
that of words, and in the retrospections of after-days have
lingered lovingly upon the memories of the same rainbow
radiance, the same celestial beam that from their own life
smiled the clouds away. It is the same charm, the same story,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old and yet ever new, and simple and beautiful always.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In endless succession, from generation to generation, are the
kisses arising from the filial and fraternal relations, the interchanges
of affection and friendship, the meetings and the
partings, the compliments of esteem and the promptings of
admiration, the outburst of grief and the beguilement of
treachery. Whether formulated by the cautious prescripts
of Mrs. Grundy and her disciples, exhibited in the bluff and
unconventional fashion of swaggering rustics, or quickened
into life with the emotional abruptness which in Brooklyn is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
termed “paroxysmal;” whether consecrated only to the holiest
affections, or peddled at church fairs and festivals as a substitute
for raffling; whether under moonlight or gaslight, by the
seaside or the fireside, it is still in its diversified forms the
one perennial beatitude, the one never-ending, still-beginning
delight, which “age cannot wither, nor custom stale;”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Said Sydney Smith, as quoted in the course of the present
volume, “We have the memory of one we received in our
youth, which lasted us forty years, and we believe it will be
one of the last things we shall think of when we die.”</p>

<p>“I would often ask her,” says Farjeon, “being of an inquisitive
turn of mind, ‘Mother, what have you got for
dinner to-day?’ ‘Bread and Cheese and Kisses,’ she would
reply merrily. Then I knew that one of our favorite dishes
was sure to be on the table, and I rejoiced accordingly. And
to this day, Bread and Cheese and Kisses bears for me in its
simple utterance a sacred and beautiful meaning. It means
contentment; it means cheerfulness; it means the exercise
of sweet words and gentle thought; it means Home!”</p>

<p>It is in the home-centre that we are first taught “such
kisses as belong to early days;” it is there that the maternal
embrace proves an efficacious restorative for infantile grievances.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Who was it caught me when I fell,</div>

</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The overture kiss to the opera of love;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">while in the maturer days of manhood courtship brings the
happy day when, as a bridegroom, he meets his bride,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And claims her with a loving kiss.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then come the kisses of connubial and parental love, and,
finally,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Life’s autumnal blossoms fall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And earth’s brown clinging lips impress</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The long cold kiss that waits us all.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The observance of the custom, therefore, throughout life,
and in all the relations of life, presents a broad field for the
inspirations of the poet and the “situations” of the novelist;
while in history, tradition, legend, and story it furnishes an
endless number of charming and picturesque episodes. To
gather together some of its varied interpretations and exemplifications
from the wide range of our accumulated literature
is the object of this volume. To recur to its ancient as well
as its modern phases, to re-awaken some of its historic memories,
to dwell briefly upon its poetic enchantments, to show
its employment in the drama and in fiction, in metaphor and
in anecdote, to exhibit its humorous side and its sorrowful
side, to unveil the strength of its sincerity and the peril of its
treachery, is the purpose of the editor. Inasmuch as the
limitations of a duodecimo are too disproportionate to such
breadth and scope of illustration to permit exhaustive treatment
of our subject, the aim is to be selective and at the same
time comprehensive. In the preparation of a work to fill a
hiatus in our modern <i>Collectanea</i>, the difficulty which is constantly
encountered is that of exclusion. Much that is worthy
of a place is necessarily omitted, but the editor trusts that the
materials which have been appropriated will measurably supply
the deficiency which has been pointed out, and prove
acceptable to a large class of readers. To those who welcome
the book it has only briefly to say, in the language of the
Eastern apologue, “I am not the rose, but I live with the
rose, and so I have become sweet.”</p>

<h3>SIGNIFICANCE AMONG THE HEBREWS.</h3>

<p>Originally, in Oriental life, the act of kissing had a
symbolical character whose import was, in many respects,
of greater breadth than that of the custom in our day.
Acts, as Dr. Beard, the German theologian, remarks,
speak no less—sometimes far more—forcibly than words.
In the early period of society, when the foundation was
laid of most even of our Western customs, action constituted
a large portion of what we may term human language,
or the means of intercommunication between man
and man; because then words were less numerous, books
unknown, the entire machinery of speaking being in its
rudimental and elementary state, less developed and called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
into play; to say nothing of that peculiarity of the Oriental
character (if, indeed, it be not a characteristic of all
nations in primitive ages) which inclined men to general
taciturnity, with occasional outbreaks of fervid, abrupt,
or copious eloquence. In this language of action, a kiss,
inasmuch as it was a bringing into contact of parts of the
body of two persons, was naturally the expression and
the symbol of affection, regard, respect, and reverence;
and if deeper source of its origin were sought for, it
would, doubtless, be found in the fondling and caresses
with which the mother expresses her tenderness for her
babe. That the custom is of very early date, and very
varied in its form among the Hebrews, may be seen in
numerous familiar citations from Holy Writ.</p>

<h3>DIVERSITIES IN THE BIBLE.</h3>

<h4>SALUTATION.</h4>

<p>David ... fell on his face to the ground, and bowed
himself three times; and they [David and Jonathan]
kissed one another, and wept one with another, until
David exceeded.—1 <i>Samuel</i> xx. 41.</p>

<p>Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.—1 <i>Thess.</i> v. 26.</p>

<p>Salute one another with a holy kiss.—<i>Romans</i> xvi. 16.</p>

<p>[See also Exod. xviii. 7; 1 Cor. xvi. 20; 1 Pet. v. 14.]</p>

<h4>VALEDICTION.</h4>

<p>The Lord grant you that ye may find rest, each of you
in the house of her husband [Naomi to her daughters-in-law].
Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their
voice, and wept.—<i>Ruth</i> i. 9.</p>

<h4>RECONCILIATION.</h4>

<p>So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he
had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
himself on his face to the ground before the king: and
the king kissed Absalom.—2 <i>Samuel</i> xiv. 33.</p>

<h4>SUBJECTION.</h4>

<p>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the
way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.—<i>Psalm</i>
ii. 12.</p>

<h4>APPROBATION.</h4>

<p>Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.—<i>Prov.</i>
xxiv. 26.</p>

<h4>ADORATION.</h4>

<p>——All the knees which have not bowed unto Baal,
and every mouth which hath not kissed him.—1 <i>Kings</i>
xix. 18.</p>

<p>[See also Hosea xiii. 2.]</p>

<p>And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began
to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the
hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed
them with the ointment.—<i>Luke</i> vii. 38.</p>

<h4>TREACHERY.</h4>

<p>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying,
Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>

<p>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Master;
and kissed him.—<i>Matt.</i> xxvi. 48, 49.</p>

<p>The kisses of an enemy are deceitful.—<i>Prov.</i> xxvii. 6.</p>

<p>[See also Prov. vii. 13.]</p>

<h4>AFFECTION.</h4>

<p>When Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son,
he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him,
and brought him to his house.—<i>Gen.</i> xxix. 13.</p>

<p>Moreover he [Joseph] kissed all his brethren, and wept
upon them.—<i>Gen.</i> xlv. 15.</p>

<p>And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon
him, and kissed him.—<i>Gen.</i> l. 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>[See also Gen. xxxi. 55, xxxiii. 4, xlviii. 10; Exod.
iv. 27; Luke xv. 20; Acts xx. 37.]</p>

<p>A Hebrew commentator on Genesis xxix. 11 says that
the Rabbins did not permit more than three kinds of
kisses, the kiss of reverence, of reception, and of dismissal.</p>

<p>With reference to the expression of reverence or worship
in the foregoing quotations, it should be noted that
to adore idols and to kiss idols mean the same thing. Indeed,
the word <i>adore</i> signifies simply to carry the hand <i>to
the mouth</i>, that is, to kiss it to the idol. We still kiss the
hand in salutation. Various parts of the body are kissed
to distinguish the character of the adoration paid. Thus,
to kiss the lips is to adore the living breath of the person
saluted; to kiss the feet or ground is to humble one’s self
in adoration; to kiss the garments is to express veneration
for whatever belongs to or touches the person who
wears them. Pharaoh tells Joseph, “Thou shalt be over
my house, and upon thy mouth shall all my people kiss,”
meaning that they would reverence the commands of
Joseph by kissing the roll on which they were written.
“Samuel poured oil on Saul, and kissed him,” to acknowledge
subjection to God’s anointed. In the Hebrew
state, this mode of expressing reverence arose from the
peculiar form of government under the patriarchal figure.</p>

<h3>SYMBOLICAL EXPRESSION AMONG THE GREEKS AND ROMANS.</h3>

<h4>ANCIENT HISTORY AND POETRY COMMINGLED.</h4>

<p>In Homer’s beautiful description of the parting of
Hector from his wife and child upon returning to the
field of battle, occurs a touching recital of paternal affection
and solicitude (Iliad, vi.). The passage is so beautiful
that we quote it at length:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stretched his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The babe clung crying to his nurse’s breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Hector hastened to relieve his child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And placed the beaming helmet on the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then kissed the child, and, lifting high in air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus to the gods preferred a father’s prayer.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“‘O thou! whose glory fills th’ ethereal throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all ye deathless powers, protect my son!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against his country’s foes the war to wage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rise the Hector of the future age!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So when, triumphant from successful toils,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And say, This chief transcends his father’s fame.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The grief of the venerable Priam upon learning of the
death of his favorite son, Hector, at the hands of Achilles,
and his journey to the Grecian camp to beg of Achilles
the body of Hector for burial, are portrayed with equal
force (Iliad, xxiv.). The Trojan monarch, prostrating
himself before the warrior,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Embraced his knees, and bathed his hands in tears;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those direful hands his kisses pressed, imbrued</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en with the best, the dearest of his blood.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the course of his entreaty, which completely softens
Achilles, the suppliant says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Think of thy father, and this face behold!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See him in me, as helpless and as old!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though not so wretched: there he yields to me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The first of men in sovereign misery!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus forced to kneel, thus grovelling to embrace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The scourge and ruin of my realm and race;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Suppliant my children’s murderer to implore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!”</div>

<p>Virgil gives us a picture similar to that of Hector when
bidding farewell to his child. Æneas, having recovered
from a dangerous wound, returns to the combat with
Turnus, first bestowing his blessing upon his son Ascanius
(Æneid, xii.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then with a close embrace he strained his son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, kissing through his helmet, thus begun:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘My son! from my example learn the war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In camps to suffer, and in fields to dare:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But happier chance than mine attend thy care!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This day my hand thy tender age shall shield,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And crown with honors of the conquered field;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To toils of war, be mindful of thy worth:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assert thy birthright; and in arms be known</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Hector’s nephew, and Æneas’ son.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Turning from the camp to the sweets of domestic life,
we find in the same charming poet (Georg. ii. 523) these
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“His cares are eased with intervals of bliss:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His little children, climbing for a kiss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Welcome their father’s late return at night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His faithful bed is crowned with chaste delight.”</div>

<p>Xenophon says, in “Agesilaus” (v. 4), that it was a
national custom with the Persians to kiss whomsoever they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
honored. And Herodotus (i. 134), in speaking of their
manners and customs, says, “If Persians meet at any time
by accident, the rank of each party is easily discovered:
if they are of equal dignity, they salute each other on the
mouth; if one is an inferior, they only kiss the cheek;
if there be a great difference in situation, the inferior falls
prostrate on the ground.” Respecting the mode of salutation
between relatives, the following passage from the
“Cyropædia” of Xenophon (i. 4) is worth transcribing:</p>

<p>“If I may be allowed to relate a sportive affair, it is
said that when Cyrus went away, and he and his relations
parted, they took their leave, and dismissed him with a
kiss, according to the Persian custom,—for the Persians
practise it to this day,—and that a certain Mede, a very
excellent person, had been long struck with the beauty
of Cyrus, and when he saw Cyrus’s relations kiss him,
he stayed behind, and, when the rest were gone, accosted
Cyrus, and said to him, ‘And am I, Cyrus, the
only one of all your relations that you do not know?’
‘What!’ said Cyrus, ‘are you a relation?’ ‘Yes,’ said
he. ‘This was the reason, then,’ said Cyrus, ‘that you
used to gaze at me; for I think I recollect that you frequently
did so.’ ‘I was very desirous,’ said he, ‘to salute
you, but I was always ashamed to do it.’ ‘But,’ said
Cyrus, ‘you that are a relation ought not to have been
so.’ So, coming up to him, he kissed him. The Mede,
having received the kiss, is said to have, asked this question:
‘And is it a custom among the Persians to kiss relations?’
‘It is so,’ said Cyrus, ‘when they see one
another at some distance of time, or when they part.’
‘Then,’ said the Mede, ‘it seems now to be time for you
to kiss me again; for, as you see, I am just going away.’
So Cyrus, kissing him again, dismissed him, and went his
way. They had not gone very far before the Mede came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
up with him again, with his horse all over in a sweat; and
Cyrus, getting sight of him, said, ‘What! have you forgotten
anything that you had a mind to say to me?’
‘No, by Jove,’ said he, ‘but I am come again at a distance
of time.’ ‘Dear relation,’ said he, ‘it is a very short
time.’ ‘How a short one?’ said the Mede: ‘do you not
know, Cyrus, that the very twinkling of my eyes is a long
time to be without seeing you, you who are so lovely?’
Here Cyrus, from being in tears, broke out into laughter,
bid him go his way and take courage, adding that in a
little time he would be with him again, and that then he
would be at liberty to look at him, if he pleased, with
steady eyes and without twinkling.”</p>

<p>The kiss among the ancients was an essential implement
in the armory of love. Virgil, for instance, uses it
in the device by which Queen Dido was to be inspired
with a passion for Æneas. Venus, in the course of her
instructions to Cupid, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thyself a boy, assume a boy’s dissembled face;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That when, amid the fervor of the feast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou mayst infuse thy venom in her veins.”</div>
  </div>

<p>Horace, in the ode to Lydia, in which he gives such
free expression to his jealousy (Ode XIII.), refers with
considerable point and feeling to the osculatory attentions
of his rival. The following translation is by Bulwer-Lytton:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When thou the rosy neck of Telephus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The waxen arms of Telephus, art praising,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Woe is me, Lydia, how my jealous heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swells with the anguish I would vainly smother!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then in my mind thought has no settled base,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To and fro shifts upon my cheek the color,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tears that glide adown in stealth reveal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By what slow fires mine inmost self consumeth.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I burn, whether he quarrel o’er his wine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stain with a bruise dishonoring thy white shoulders,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or whether my boy-rival on thy lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leave by a scar the mark of his rude kisses.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hope not, if thou wouldst hearken unto me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That one so little kind prove always constant;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">By Venus with a fifth part of her nectar.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thrice happy, ay, more than thrice happy, they</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Whose love serene from bickering and reproach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In life’s last moment finds the first that severs.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The closing lines of an ode to Mæcenas (Lib. II. Ode
XII.) are worth noting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Say, for all that Achæmenes boasted of treasure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All the wealth which Mygdonia gave Phrygia in tribute,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All the stores of all Araby—say, wouldst thou barter</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">One lock of Lycimnia’s bright hair?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When at moments she bends down her neck to thy kisses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or declines them with coy but not cruel denial,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rather pleased if the prize be snatched off by the spoiler,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Nor slow in reprisal sometimes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Literally, “when she turns to meet the ardent kisses,
or with a gentle cruelty denies what she would more delight
to have ravished by the petitioner; sometimes she is
eager to snatch them herself.”</p>

<p>In the Latin Anthology is an ode to another Lydia, by
an unknown poet, but probably Gallus, which breathes
throughout the rapturous idolatry of the enamored writer.
We have only space for these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Unveil those rosy cheeks, o’erspread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With blushes of the Tyrian red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pout those coral lips of thine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And breathe the turtle’s kiss on mine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deep on my heart you print that kiss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You melt my wildered soul in bliss.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, softly, girl! thy amorous play</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has sucked my very blood away!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hide thy twin bosom fruit, just shown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Milk-ripe above thy bursting zone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such sweets, as India’s summer gale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wafts from her spice-beds, they exhale.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/line.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p>Ovid appropriates the kiss most effectively in his passages
descriptive of the endearments, the fascinations,
the yearnings, and the transports of love. Briseis in her
letter to Achilles, begging him to return to the Grecian
camp, is made to say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh that the Greeks would send me hence to try</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I could make your stubborn heart comply!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Few words I’d use; all should be sighs, and tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And looks, and kisses, mixed with hopes and fears;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My love like lightning through my eyes should fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thaw the ice which round your heart does lie;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sometimes my arms about your neck I’d throw;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then embrace your knees and humbly bow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is more eloquence in tears and kisses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than in the smooth harangues of sly Ulysses.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the letter of Sappho to her lover, Phaon, when he
had forsaken her, and she had resolved upon suicide, we
have a picture of that “sorrow’s crown of sorrow,” the
remembrance in adversity of happier days:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yet once your Sappho could your cares employ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once in her arms you centred all your joy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still all those joys to my remembrance move,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, oh, how vast a memory has love!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My music then you could forever hear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all my words were music to your ear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You stopped with kisses my enchanting tongue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And found my kisses sweeter than my song.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fair Sicilians now your soul inflame:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why was I born, ye gods, a Lesbian dame?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A wife’s affection is shown in the letter of Laodanna to
her husband at Aulis with the Grecian fleet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yet while before the leaguer thou dost lie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy picture is some pleasure to my eye;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There must be something in it more than art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twere very thee, could it thy mind impart:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I kiss the pretty idol, and complain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if (like thee) ’twould answer me again.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This pretty conceit, which the moderns have often
copied from Ovid, occurs in the epistle of Paris to Helen:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you your young Hermione but kiss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Straight from her lips I snatch the envied bliss.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In his “Art of Love” (Book I.) Ovid thus pursues his
course of instruction:</p>

<p>“Tears, too, are of utility: by tears you will move
adamant. Make her, if you can, to see your moistened
cheeks. If tears shall fail you, for indeed they do not
always come in time, touch your eyes with your wet hand.
What discreet person will not mingle kisses with tender
words? Though she should not grant them, still take
them ungranted. Perhaps she will struggle at first, and
will say, ‘You naughty man!’ Still, in her struggling
she will wish to be overcome. Only, let them not, rudely
snatched, hurt her tender lips, and take care that she may
not be able to complain that they have proved a cause of
pain. He who has gained kisses, if he cannot gain the
rest as well, will deserve to lose even that which has been
granted him. How much is there wanting for unlimited
enjoyment after a kiss! Oh, shocking! ’twere clownishness,
not modesty. Call it violence, if you like; such
violence is pleasing to the fair; they often wish, through
compulsion, to grant what they are delighted to grant.”</p>

<p>Turning from Ovid to the Greek Anthology, we find
this epigram:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The kiss that she left on my lip</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Like a dew-drop shall lingering lie:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas nectar she gave me to sip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Twas nectar I drank in her sigh!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The dew that distilled in that kiss</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To my soul was voluptuous wine:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ever since it is drunk with the bliss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And feels a delirium divine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/line.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p>Anacreon, in one of his odes, speaks of the heart flying
to the lips; and Plato, in a distich quoted by Aulus
Gellius, tells us of the effect of a kiss upon his susceptibility:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whene’er thy nectared kiss I sip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And drink thy breath in melting twine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My soul then flutters to my lip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ready to fly and mix with thine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Plato also wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My soul, when I kissed Agathon, did start</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Up to my lips, just ready to depart.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Oh! on that kiss my soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">As if in doubt to stay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lingered awhile, on fluttering wing prepared</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To fly away.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/line.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p>Anacreon uses this figurative expression:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“They tainted all his bowl of blisses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His bland desires and hallowed kisses.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By the ancient expression “cups of kisses,” reference
is most probably made to a favorite gallantry among the
Greeks and Romans of drinking when the lips of their
mistresses had touched the brim. Ben Jonson’s oft-quoted
verses to Celia, in which occur the lines—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Or leave a kiss within the cup,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’ll not ask for wine,”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">are translated from Philostratus, a Greek poet of the
second century.</p>

<p>Lucian has a conceit upon the same idea: “that you
may at once both drink and kiss.” And Meleager says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Blest is the goblet, oh! how blest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which Heliodora’s lips have pressed!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! might thy lips but meet with mine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My soul should melt away in thine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Agathias also says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I love not wine; but thou hast power</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Then hand it round for mine to sip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And temperance at once gives way;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My sweet cup-bearer wins the day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That cup’s a boat which ferries over</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy kiss in safety to thy lover,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tells by its delicious flavor</div>

<p>Longepierre, to give an idea of the luxurious estimation
in which garlands were held by the ancients, relates
an anecdote of a frail beauty, who, in order to gratify
three lovers without leaving cause for jealousy with any
of them, gave a kiss to one, let the other drink after her,
and put a garland on the brow of the third; so that each
was satisfied with his favor, and flattered himself with
the preference.</p>

<p>In one of Anacreon’s odes we find the strong and
beautiful phrase, “a lip provoking kisses.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then her lip, so rich in blisses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sweet petitioner for kisses.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tatius speaks of “lips soft and delicate for kissing;”
and that grave old commentator, Lambinus, in his notes
upon Lucretius, tells us, with all the authority of experience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
that girls who have large lips kiss infinitely sweeter
than others!</p>

<p>Æneas Sylvius, in his story of the loves of Euryalus
and Lucretia, where he particularizes the beauties of the
heroine, describes her lips as exquisitely adapted for
biting.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And Catullus, in his poems (viii.), asks,
“Whom will you love now? Whose will you be called?
Whom will you kiss? Whose lips will you bite? But
you, Catullus, be stubbornly obdurate.” As Lamb has it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whose fondling care shalt thou avow?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whose kisses now shalt thou return?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose lip in rapture bite? But thou,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hold, hold, Catullus, cold and stern.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or, as Elton renders it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whom wilt thou for thy lover choose?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose shall they call thee, false one, whose?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who shall thy darted kisses sip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While thy keen love-bites scar his lip?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But thou, Catullus, scorn to feel:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Persist—and let thy heart be steel.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Plautus alludes to this biting;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and Horace says (Ode
XIII.), as already quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Or on thy lips the fierce fond boy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Marks with his teeth the furious joy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Plutarch tells us that Flora, the mistress of Cn. Pompey,
used to say, in commendation of her lover, that she
could never quit his arms without giving him a bite. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Tibullus, in his confession of his illicit love for Delia, the
wife of another, and of his devices for covering his tracks,
says, among other things, “I gave her juices and herbs
for removing the livid marks which mutual Venus makes
by the impress of the teeth.”</p>

<p>Anacreon finds in the brevity of life arguments for the
voluptuary as well as for the moralist:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Can we discern, with all our lore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The path we’re yet to journey o’er?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No, no, the walk of life is dark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis wine alone can strike a spark!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then let me quaff the foamy tide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And through the dance meandering glide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let me imbibe the spicy breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of odors chafed to fragrant death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or from the kiss of love inhale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A more voluptuous, richer gale.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/line.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p>Of the amatory writers who exhaust rhetoric to express
the infinity of kisses which they require from the lips of
their mistresses, Catullus takes the lead. In his famous
verses to Lesbia (Carm. 5), he says:</p>

<p>“Let us live and love, my Lesbia, and a farthing for
all the talk of morose old sages! Suns may set and rise
again; but we, when once our brief light has set, must
sleep through a perpetual night. Give me a thousand
kisses, then a hundred, then another thousand, then a
second hundred, then still another thousand, then a hundred.
Then, when we shall have made up many thousands,
we will confuse the reckoning, so that we ourselves may
not know their amount, nor any spiteful person have it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
in his power to envy us when he knows that our kisses
were so many.”</p>

<p>Roman superstition recognized an occult and mischievous
potency in the sentiment of envy. Moreover,
there was a prevalent notion that it excited the envy of
the gods to <i>count</i> what gave one pleasure.</p>

<p>The following metrical versions of the foregoing are
worth a place here. The first is by George Lamb (1821):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Love, my Lesbia, while we live;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Value all the cross advice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the surly graybeards give</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At a single farthing’s price.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Suns that set again may rise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">We, when once our fleeting light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once our day in darkness dies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sleep in one eternal night.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Give me kisses thousand-fold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Add to them a hundred more;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Other thousands still be told,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Other hundreds, o’er and o’er.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But, with thousands when we burn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Mix, confuse the sums at last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That we may not blushing learn</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All that have between us past.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“None shall know to what amount</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Envy’s due for so much bliss;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None—for none shall ever count</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All the kisses we will kiss.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The second is by C. A. Elton, whose translations of
the classic poets were first published in 1814:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let us, my Lesbia, live and love;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though the old should disapprove;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us rate their saws severe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the worth of a denier.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Suns can set beneath the main,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lift their fated, orbs again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But we, when sets our scanted light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must slumber in perpetual night.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me, then, a thousand kisses;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Add a hundred billing blisses;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me a thousand kisses more;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then repeat the hundred o’er;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me other thousand kisses;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me other hundred blisses;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when thousands now are done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us confuse them every one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That we the number cannot know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And none that saw us kissing so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might glut his envious busy spleen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By counting o’er the kisses that had been.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another poem addressed to Lesbia (Carm. 7), Catullus
says:</p>

<p>“You ask how many kisses of yours, Lesbia, maybe
enough for me; and more. As the numerous sands that
lie on the spicy shores of Cyrene, between the oracle of
sultry Jove and the sacred tomb of old Battus;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or as the
many stars that in the silence of night behold men’s
furtive amours; to kiss you with so many kisses is enough
and more for madly fond Catullus; such a multitude as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
prying gossips can neither count, nor bewitch with their
evil tongues.”</p>

<p>Lamb’s translation is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thy kisses dost thou bid me count,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tell thee, Lesbia, what amount</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My rage for love and thee could tire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And satisfy and cloy desire?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Many as grains of Libyan sand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon Cyrene’s spicy land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From prescient Ammon’s sultry dome</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To sacred Battus’ ancient tomb:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many as stars that silent ken</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At night the stolen loves of men.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, when the kisses thou shalt kiss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have reached a number vast as this,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then may desire at length be stayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And e’en my madness be allayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then when infinity defies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The calculations of the wise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor evil voice’s deadly charm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can work the unknown number harm.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thomas Moore gives the following exceedingly free
rendering of the answer to the question:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“As many stellar eyes of light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As through the silent waste of night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gazing upon the world of shade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Witness some secret youth and maid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, fair as thou, and fond as I,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In stolen joys enamored lie,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So many kisses, ere I slumber,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon those dew-bright lips I’ll number;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So many vermil, honeyed kisses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Envy can never count our blisses:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">No tongue shall tell the sum but mine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No lips shall fascinate but thine!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We cannot dismiss Catullus without one more specimen
of his osculatory exuberance. In his lines “To My Love”
(Carm. 48), he says:</p>

<p>“Were I allowed to kiss your sweet eyes without stint, I
would kiss on and on up to three hundred thousand times;
nor even then should I ever have enough, not though our
crop of kissing were thicker than the dry ears of the cornfield.”</p>

<p>Or in Lamb’s metrical version:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If, all-complying, thou wouldst grant</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thy lovely eyes to kiss, my fair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long as I pleased, oh! I would plant</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Three hundred thousand kisses there.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nor could I even then refrain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor satiate leave that fount of blisses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though thicker than autumnal grain</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Should be our growing crop of kisses.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/line.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p>Martial, in his “Epigrams,” bestows a variety of attentions
upon the promiscuous custom of kissing in Rome,
as he found it in his day. In an epigram addressed to his
friend Flaccus (xii. 98), he complains in very strong and
very amusing terms of the persistent salutes of a certain
class, who paid no heed whatever to times and seasons,
places and circumstances, but broke through all forms
and guards and conventional restraints.</p>

<p>On another occasion he pointed his invective in this
manner (xii. 59):</p>

<p>“Rome gives, on one’s return after fifteen years’ absence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
such a number of kisses as exceeds those given by
Lesbia to Catullus. Every neighbor, every hairy-faced
farmer, presses on you with a strongly-scented kiss. Here
the weaver assails you, there the fuller and the cobbler,
who has just been kissing leather; here the owner of a
filthy beard, and a one-eyed gentleman; there one with
bleared eyes, and fellows whose mouths are defiled with
all manner of abominations. It was hardly worth while
to return.”</p>

<p>His epigram to Linus (vii. 95) is rarely exceeded in its
sarcastic severity. It closes in this manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent28">——“No doubt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ icicles hanging at thy dog-like snout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The congealed snivel dangling on thy beard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ranker than th’ oldest goat of all the herd.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The nastiest mouth in town I’d rather greet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than with thy flowing frozen nostrils meet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If therefore thou hast either shame or sense,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till April comes no kisses more dispense.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The satirist thus pays his respects to a lady whose physical
attractions do not appear to have had much charm
for his fastidious taste:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In vain, fond Philænis, thou woo’st my embrace:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bald, carrotty, one-eyed, thy tripartite grace!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wretch, poor Philænis, that would thee salute,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can never aspire to the buss of a brute.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(ii. 33.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Why on my chin a plaster clapped?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Besalved my lips that are not chapped?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Philænis, why? The cause is this:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Philænis, thee I will not kiss.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(x. 22).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>The illustrious Postumus comes in for a share of repugnance
in this delicate fashion. We give the literal translation:</p>

<p>“I commend you, Postumus, for kissing me with only
half your lip; you may, however, if you please, withhold
even the half of this half. Are you inclined to grant me
a boon still greater, and even inexpressible? Keep this
whole half entirely to yourself, Postumus.” (ii. 10.)</p>

<p>And elsewhere, thus:</p>

<p>“To some, Postumus, you give kisses, to some your
right hand. ‘Which do you prefer?’ you say: ‘choose.’
I prefer your hand.”</p>

<p>In another place (iii. 53) Martial addresses Chloe in
this ungallant and uncourtly style:</p>

<p>“I could do without your face, and your neck, and
your hands, and your limbs, and your bosom, and other
of your charms. Indeed, not to fatigue myself with enumerating
each of them, I could do without you, Chloe,
altogether.”</p>

<p>This <i>brusquerie</i> has been imitated by Thomas Moore in
the following manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I could resign that eye of blue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Howe’er its splendor used to thrill me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And e’en that cheek of roseate hue—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To lose it, Chloe, scarce would kill me.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That snowy neck I ne’er should miss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">However much I’ve raved about it;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sweetly as that lip can kiss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I <i>think</i> I could exist without it.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In short, so well I’ve learned to fast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That sooth, my love, I know not whether</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I might not bring myself at last</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">——To do without you altogether.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, when it comes to the kisses of his
favorite (xi. 8), Martial indulges in the following exuberant
fancy:</p>

<p>“The fragrance of balsam extracted from aromatic trees;
the ripe odor yielded by the teeming saffron; the perfume
of fruits mellowing in their winter repository; or of the
flowery meadows in the vernal season; or of silken robes
of the empress from her Palatine wardrobes; of amber
warmed by the hand of a maiden; of a jar of dark Falernian
wine, broken and scented from a distance; of a
garden that attracts the Sicilian bees; of the alabaster
jars of Cosmus, and the altars of the gods; of the chaplet
just fallen from the brow of the luxurious;—but why
should I mention all these things singly? not one of them
is enough by itself; mix all together,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and you have the
perfume of the morning kisses of my favorite. Do you
want to know the name? I will only tell you of the
kisses. You swear to be secret. You want to know
too much, Sabinus.”</p>

<p>One more selection from Martial (vi. 34) will suffice
for this branch of our subject:</p>

<p>“Give me, Diadumenus, close kisses. ‘How many?’
you say. You bid me count the waves of the ocean, the
shells scattered on the shores of the Ægean Sea, the bees
that wander on Attic Hybla, or the voices and clappings
that resound in the full theatre when the people
suddenly see the countenance of the emperor. I should
not be content even with as many as Lesbia, after many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
entreaties, gave to the witty Catullus: he wants but few
who can count them.”</p>

<p>The following imitation was written by Sir C. Hanbury
Williams:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come, Chloe, and give me sweet kisses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For sweeter sure girl never gave;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But why, in the midst of my blisses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Do you ask me how many I’d have?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m not to be stinted in pleasure;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then, prithee, my charmer, be kind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, while I love thee above measure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To numbers I’ll ne’er be confined.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Count the bees that on Hybla are playing;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Count the flowers that enamel its fields;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count the flocks that on Tempe are straying;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or the grain that rich Sicily yields.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Go number the stars in the heaven;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Count how many sands on the shore:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When so many kisses you’ve given,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I still shall be craving for more.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To a heart full of love let me hold thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To a heart which, dear Chloe, is thine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With my arms I’ll forever enfold thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And twist round thy limbs like a vine.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What joy can be greater than this is?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My life on thy lips shall be spent;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the wretch that can number his kisses</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With few will be ever content.”</div>

<h3>TRACES IN ENGLISH HISTORY.</h3>

<p>Kissing appears to have been the usual method of
salutation in England in former times. A Greek traveller,
named Chalondyles, who visited Britain five centuries
ago, says:</p>

<p>“As for English females and children, their customs are
liberal in the extreme. For instance, when a visitor calls
at a friend’s house, his first act is to kiss his friend’s wife;
he is then a duly-installed guest. Persons meeting in the
street follow the same custom, and no one sees anything
improper in the action.”</p>

<p>Another Greek traveller of a century later, also adverts
to this osculatory custom. He says:</p>

<p>“The English manifest much simplicity and lack of
jealousy in their customs as regards females; for not only
do members of the same family and household kiss them
on the lips with complimentary salutations and enfolding
of the arms round the waist, but even strangers, when introduced,
follow the same mode, and it is one which does
not appear to them in any degree unbecoming.”</p>

<p>Chaucer often alludes to it. Thus, the Frere in the
Sompnour’s Tale, upon the entrance of the mistress of
the house into the room where her husband and he were
together,</p>

<p>Robert de Brunne (1303) says that the custom formed

<p>In Hone’s “Year-Book” occurs the following passage:</p>

<p>“Another specimen of our ancient manners is seen in
the French embrace. The gentleman, and others of the
male sex, lay hands on the shoulders, and touch the side
of each other’s cheek; but on being introduced to a lady,
they say to her father, brother, or friend, <i>Permettez moi</i>,
and salute each of her cheeks.... And was not this
custom in England in Elizabeth’s reign? Let us read
one of the epistles of the learned Erasmus, which, being
translated, is in part as follows:</p>

<p>“‘Although, Faustus, if you knew the advantages of
Britain, truly you would hasten thither with wings to your
feet; and, if your gout would not permit, you would wish
you possessed the wings of Dædalus. For just to touch
on one thing out of many here, there are lasses with
heavenly faces, kind, obliging, and you would far prefer
them to all your Muses. There is, besides, a practice
never to be sufficiently commended. If you go to any
place, you are received with a kiss by all; if you depart
on a journey, you are dismissed with a kiss; if you return,
the kisses are exchanged. Do they come to visit you, a
kiss is the first thing; do they leave you, you kiss them
all around. Do they meet you anywhere, kisses in abundance.
In short, wherever you turn, there is nothing but
kisses. Ah, Faustus, if you had once tasted the tenderness,
the fragrance of these kisses, you would wish to stay
in England, not for ten years only, but for life.”</p>

<p>This unctuous expatiation of the far-famed Dutchman
is in rather broad contrast with the stern reprobation of
John Bunyan, who says, in his “Grace Abounding:”</p>

<p>“The common salutation of women I abhor; it is odious
to me in whomsoever I see it. When I have seen good
men salute those women that they have visited, or that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
have visited them, I have made my objection against it;
and when they have answered that it was but a piece of
civility, I have told them that it was not a comely sight.
Some, indeed, have urged the holy kiss; but then I have
asked them why they have made balks? why they did
salute the most handsome, and let the ill-favored ones go?”</p>

<p>More than a century before this decided expression of
the great allegorist, Richard Whytford had said, in his
“Type of Perfection” (1532):</p>

<p>“It becometh not, therefore, the personnes religious to
follow <i>the manere of secular personnes</i>, that in theyr congresses
or commune metynges, or departyngs, done use to
kysse, take hands, or such other touchings that good religious-personnes
shulde utterly avoyde.”</p>

<p>In Collet’s “Relics of Literature” maybe found this
suggestive paragraph:</p>

<p>“Dr. Pierius Winsemius, historiographer to their High
Mightinesses the States of Friesland, in his <i>Chronijck van
Frieslandt</i>, 1622, tells us that the pleasant practice of
kissing was utterly ‘unpractised and unknown’ in England
till the fair princess Ronix (Rowena), the daughter
of King Hengist of Friesland, ‘pressed the beaker with
her lipkens, and saluted the amorous Vortigern with a
husjen (a little kiss).’”</p>

<p>But, whether this Anglo-Saxon incident be true or
mythical, it is certain that in the time of Cardinal Wolsey,
who lived cotemporaneously with Erasmus, from
whom we have quoted, the osculatory reputation of the
English was widely spread. Cavendish, the biographer
of Wolsey, says, in reference to a visit at the château of
M. Créqui, a distinguished French nobleman:</p>

<p>“Being in a fair great dining chamber, I awaited my
Lady’s coming; and after she came thither out of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
own chamber, she received me most gently, like one of
noble estate, having a train of twelve gentlewomen. And
when she with her train came all out, she said to me,
‘Forasmuch as ye be an Englishman, whose custom is in
your country to kiss all ladies and gentlewomen without
offence, and <i>although it be not so here</i> in this realm [France,
<i>temp.</i> Henry VIII.], yet will I be so bold to kiss you,
and so shall all my maidens.’ By means whereof, I
kissed my lady and all her women.”</p>

<p>When Bulstrode Whitelock was at the court of Queen
Christina of Sweden, as ambassador from Oliver Cromwell,
he waited on her on May-day, to invite her to
“take the air, and some little collation he had provided
as her humble servant.” She came with her ladies; and
“both in supper-time and afterwards,” being “full of
pleasantness and gayety of spirits, among other frolics,
commanded him to teach her ladies <i>the English mode of
salutation</i>, which, after some pretty defences, their lips
obeyed, and Whitelock most readily.”</p>

<p>In a curious book published in London in 1694, entitled
“The Ladies’ Dictionary; being a General Entertainment
for the Fair Sex,” the author, who deals with
the fashions of the time, remarks under the article “Kissing,”
as follows:</p>

<p>“But kissing and drinking both are now grown (it
seems) to be a greater custom amongst us than in those
days with the Romans. Nor am I so austere to forbid the
use of either, both which, though the one in surfeits, the
other in adulteries, may be abused by the vicious; yet contrarily
at customary meetings and laudable banquets, they
by the nobly disposed, and such whose hearts are fixed
upon honor, may be used with much modesty and continence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>This osculatory custom seems to have disappeared about
the time of the Restoration. Peter Heylin says it had for
some time before been unfashionable in France. When
he visited that country, in 1625, he thought it strange and
uncivil that the ladies should turn away from the proffer
of a salutation; and he indignantly exclaims “that the
chaste and innocent kiss of an English gentlewoman is
more in heaven than their best devotions.” Its abandonment
in England might have formed part of that French
code of politeness which Charles II. introduced on his return.
Apropos of this, we may here quote a letter of
Rustic Sprightly to the “Spectator” (No. 240):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Mr. Spectator</span>,</p>

<p>“I am a country gentleman, of a good, plentiful estate,
and live as the rest of my neighbors, with great hospitality.
I have been ever reckoned among the ladies the best company
in the world, and have access as a sort of favorite.
I never came in public but I saluted them, though in
great assemblies, all around; where it was seen how genteelly
I avoided hampering my spurs in their petticoats,
whilst I moved amongst them; and on the other side
how prettily they curtsied and received me, standing in
proper rows, and advancing as fast as they saw their
elders, or their betters, dispatched by me. But so it is,
<span class="smcap">Mr. Spectator</span>, that all our good breeding is of late lost
by the unhappy arrival of a courtier, or town gentleman,
who came lately among us. This person, whenever he
came into a room, made a profound bow and fell back,
then recovered with a soft air, and made a bow to the
next, and so to one or two more, and then took the gross
of the room by passing by them in a continued bow till
he arrived at the person he thought proper particularly to
entertain. This he did with so good a grace and assurance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
that it is taken for the present fashion; and there is
no young gentlewoman within several miles of this place
has been kissed ever since his first appearance among us.
We country gentlemen cannot begin again and learn these
fine and reserved airs; and our conversation is at a stand
till we have your judgment for or against kissing by way
of civility or salutation, which is impatiently expected by
your friends of both sexes, but by none so much as</p>

<p class="center">“Your humble servant,</p>

<p>The custom of salutation by kissing appears to have
prevailed in Scotland about 1637. It is incidentally
noticed in the following extract from “Memoirs of the
Life of Tames Mitchell, of Dykes, in the Parish of Ardrossan
(Ayrshire), written by himself,” Glasgow, 1759,
p. 85; a rare tract of 111 pages:</p>

<p>“The next business (as I spake before) was the Lord’s
goodness and providence towards me, in that particular,
with Mr. Alexander Dunlop, our minister, when he fell
first into his reveries and distractions of groundless jealousy
of his wife with sundry gentlemen, and of me in
special. First, I have to bless God on my part he had
not so much as a presumption (save his own fancies) of
my misbehavior in any sort; for, as I shall be accountable
to that great God, before whose tribunal I must stand and
give an account at that great day, I was not only free of
all actual villany with that gentlewoman his wife, but
also of all scandalous misbehavior either in private or
public: yea, further, as I shall be saved at that great day,
I did not so much as kiss her mouth in courtesy (so far as
my knowledge and memory serves me) seven years before
his jealousy brake forth: this was the ground of no small
peace of my mind, ... and last of all, the Lord brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
me clearly off the pursuit, and since he and I has keeped
general fashions of common civility to this day, <i>12 December,
1637</i>. I pray God may open his eyes and give
him a sight of his weakness and insufficiency both one
way and other. Now praise, honor, glory, and dominion
be to God only wise (for this and all other his providences
and favors unto me), now and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>“I subscribe with my hand the truth of this,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">James Mitchell</span>.”</p>

<p>Relative to kissing among men, Sir Walter Scott has
the following passage in “Waverley” (ch. x.):</p>

<p>“At his first address to Waverley, it would seem that
the hearty pleasure he felt to behold the nephew of his
friend had somewhat discomposed the stiff and upright
dignity of the Baron of Bradwardine’s demeanor, for the
tears stood in the old gentleman’s eyes, when, having
first shaken Edward heartily by the hand in the English
fashion, he embraced him <i>à-la-mode Françoise</i>, and kissed
him on both sides of his face; while the hardness of his
gripe, and the quantity of Scotch snuff which his <i>accolade</i>
communicated, called corresponding drops of moisture
to the eyes of his guest.”</p>

<p>In “Rob Roy” Sir Walter also says (ch. xxxvi.):</p>

<p>“A boat waited for us in a creek beneath a huge
rock, manned by four lusty Highland rowers; and our
host took leave of us with great cordiality and even
affection. Betwixt him and Mr. Jarvie, indeed, there
seemed to exist a degree of mutual regard, which formed
a strong contrast to their different occupations and
habits. After kissing each other very lovingly, and
when they were just in the act of parting, the Bailie, in
the fulness of his heart, and with a faltering voice, assured
his kinsman that ‘if ever a hundred pund, or even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
twa hundred, would put him or his family in a settled
way, he need but just send a line to the Saut-Market;’
and Rob, grasping his basket-hilt with one hand, and
shaking Mr. Jarvie’s heartily with the other, protested
‘that if ever anybody should affront his kinsman, an he
would but let him ken, he would stow his lugs out of his
head, were he the best man in Glasgow.’”</p>

<p>Evelyn, in his “Diary and Correspondence,” writing
to Mrs. Owen, says:</p>

<p>“Sir J. Shaw did us the honor of a visit on Thursday
last, when it was not my hap to be at home, for which I
was very sorry. I met him since casually in London,
and kissed him there unfeignedly.”</p>

<p>And Charles Dickens, in “Little Dorrit,” gives us this
amusing paragraph:</p>

<p>“‘You will draw upon us to-morrow, sir,’ said Mr.
Flintwich, with a business-like face, at parting.</p>

<p>“‘My cabbage,’ returned Mr. Blandois, taking him by
the collar with both hands, ‘I’ll draw upon you; have
no fear. Adieu, my Flintwich. Receive at parting’—here
he gave him a southern embrace, and kissed him
soundingly on both cheeks—‘the word of a gentleman!
By a thousand thunders, you shall see me again.’”</p>

<p>As a token of affection between father and son, the kiss,
of course, has prevailed from time immemorial. Wickliffe,
in his quaint rendering of the Bible, thus translates
one of the earliest recorded instances, that of Isaac and
Jacob (Gen. xxvii. 26, 27):</p>

<p>“Gyve to me a cosse, son myn. He come near and
cossed him.”</p>

<p>But the preference in most cases, it must be confessed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
is that of the young English sailor in Congreve’s “Love
for Love.” On his return, Ben dutifully seeks his father:</p>

<p>“<i>Sir Sampson.</i> My son Ben! Bless thee, my dear
boy; thou art heartily welcome.</p>

<p>“<i>Ben.</i> Thank you, father; and I’m glad to see you.</p>

<p>“<i>Sir S.</i> Odsbud, and I’m glad to see thee. Kiss me,
boy; kiss me again and again, dear Ben. [<i>Kisses him.</i>]</p>

<p>“<i>Ben.</i> So, so; enough, father. Mess, I’d rather kiss
these gentlewomen.</p>

<p>“<i>Sir S.</i> And so thou shalt,” etc.</p>

<p>And so he does, with right good will and alacrity.</p>

<h3>MEMORABLE KISSES.</h3>

<p>That was a wonderful kiss which Fatima received from
her lover:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Last night when some one spoke his name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From my swift blood that went and came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A thousand little shafts of flame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were shivered in my narrow frame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, love! oh, fire! Once he drew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With one long kiss my whole soul through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My lips—as sunlight drinketh dew.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then there was the precious kiss which Margarida gave
her troubadour lover, when “she stretched out her arms
and sweetly embraced him in the love-chamber,” which
coming to the knowledge of her husband (Raimon de
Roussillon), he gave her the troubadour’s heart to eat,
disguised as a savory morsel. And there was Francesca’s
kiss, so sweet and yet so sad, so guilty and so pure, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
trembling Paolo kissed her and they read no more that
day. And there are the kisses that Antony wasted a world
so gladly for, “on a brow of Egypt,”—or rather, we suspect,
on lips of Egypt,—and Othello’s farewell kisses,
which, tender and heart-broken as they were, had no
magic in them to redeem poor Desdemona’s life. Who
does not remember that grand kiss of Coriolanus—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which exhibits such a world of character and passion?
and Romeo’s dying kiss in the vault of the Capulets? and
the famous kiss of Bassanio? Then there is the kiss
Queen Margaret gave Alain Chartier, the memory of
which is still fresh after three centuries have passed away.
He was a poet, and the ugliest man in France. The last
of his race died in Paris in November, 1863. The queen
with her maids found him asleep one day, and bent over
him and kissed his dreaming lips. “I kiss not the man,”
she said; “I kiss the soul that sings.” Another poet,
the countryman of Chartier, had, two centuries later, the
honor of being publicly kissed in the stage-box by the
young and lovely Countess de Villars; but in Voltaire’s
case the lady gave the osculatory salute not of her own free
will, but in obedience to the commands of the <i>claqueurs</i>
in the pit, mad with enthusiasm for the poet’s “Merope.”
Then there is the kiss which the fresh cheek of young
John Milton received, during his college days, from the
lips of the high-born Italian beauty, and the kisses of
Laurence Sterne, concerning which he says, “For my
own part, I would rather kiss the lips I love than dance
with all the graces of Greece, after bathing themselves in
the springs of Parnassus. Flesh and blood for me, with
an angel in the inside.”</p>

<p>Here is a white rose that has not faded through three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
hundred years,—the white rose sent by a Yorkist lover to
his Lancaster inamorata:<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If this fair rose offend thy sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Placed in thy bosom bare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twill blush to find itself less white,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And turn Lancastrian there.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But if thy ruby lips it spy,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">With envy pale ’twill lose its dye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And Yorkist turn again.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is a pity that we do not know who plucked that rose
with such courtly grace. The lines, like “Chevy Chase,”
“The Nut-brown Maid,” and “Allan-a-Dale,” are a
<i>filius nullius</i>, and, like many other anonymous waifs which
have floated down to us, could, just as well as not, have
carried a name on to immortality. What sort of a kiss
was it that sweet Amy Robsart’s friend Leicester placed
upon the lips of Queen Bess, and which, according to a
chronicle of the time, “she took right heartilie”? It
was certainly a bold proceeding “before folks,” considering
who the parties were. The kiss that Chastelard
asked of Mary Beaton was a notable one. Said the gallant
Frenchman:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Kiss me with some slow, heavy kiss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That plucks the heart out at the lips.”</div>

<p>When the Cardinal John of Lorraine was presented to
the Duchess of Savoy, she gave him her hand to kiss,
greatly to the indignation of the churchman. “How,
madam!” exclaimed he: “am I to be treated in this manner?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
I kiss the queen, my mistress, and shall I not kiss
you, who are only a duchess?” and without more ado
he, despite the resistance of the proud little Portuguese
princess, kissed her thrice on the mouth before he released
her with an exultant laugh. The doughty cardinal
was apparently of one mind with Sheldon, who thought
that “to kiss ladies’ hands after their lips, as some do, is
like little boys who, after they eat the apple, fall to the
paring.”</p>

<p>The proud and pompous Constable of Castile, on his
visit to the English court soon after the accession of
James I., we are told, was right well pleased to bestow
a kiss on Anne of Denmark’s lovely maids of honor,
“according to the custom of the country, and any neglect
of which is taken as an affront.”</p>

<p>When Charles II. was making his triumphal progress
through England, certain country ladies who were presented
to him, instead of kissing the royal hands, in their
simplicity held up their pretty lips to be kissed by the
king,—a blunder no one would more willingly excuse
than the red-haired lover of pretty Nell Gwynn.</p>

<p>When the excommunicated German emperor Henry
IV. had been humbled by three days of penance, barefoot
and fasting, in the month of January, before the
palace of Pope Gregory VII., he was admitted to “the
superlative honor” of kissing the pontiff’s toe. This,
perhaps, was no greater humiliation than that of the
haughty Doge, who, after seeing Genoa bombarded by
the fleet of Louis XIV. on account of the assistance he
had given to the Algerines, was reduced to the indignity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
of going to Versailles to kiss the hand which had given
his city to the flames.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette frequently shocked the etiquette
of her day at the French court. Once, upon receiving
the Austrian ambassador, Count von Mercy, she advanced
to meet him, and reached her hand to him, allowing him
to press it to his lips. Of course Madame de Noailles
was horror-stricken. The kissing of the queen’s hand
was a state ceremonial, and inadmissible at a private
interview.</p>

<p>A pleasanter incident at the court of this queen is thus
related by Madame Campan:</p>

<p>“Franklin appeared at court in the costume of an
American husbandman: his hair straight and without
powder, his round hat, and coat of brown cloth, formed
a strong contrast with the spangled and embroidered coats,
the powdered and pomatumed head-dresses, of the courtiers
of Versailles. This novelty charmed all the lively
imaginations of the French ladies. They gave elegant
fêtes to Doctor Franklin, who united the fame of one of
the most skilful physicians [Madame Campan was led
into this mistake by Franklin’s title of doctor] to the
patriotic virtues which induced him to take the noble rôle
of apostle of liberty. I was present at one of these fêtes,
where the most beautiful (the Comtesse de Polignac)
among three hundred ladies was chosen to go and place a
crown of laurel on the white hair of the American philosopher,
and kiss both cheeks of the old man.”</p>

<p>Tom Hood once asked whether Hannah More had
ever been kissed,—that is to say, by a man. It is almost
impossible to conceive of such a thing; and yet it has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
asserted by one of the authors of the “Rejected Addresses.”
But to think of her having been kissed “on
the sly,” and in church-time! Horace Smith distinctly
affirms that, on a certain occasion,</p>

<p>Chevalier Bunsen, who rose from a humble position
in life to great honor, was a man of vast <i>savoir</i> but little
erudition. As a theologian, the character to which he
most aspired, he was severely criticised by the celebrated
Dr. Merle d’Aubigné. The two savans met at Berlin at
the Evangelical Alliance held several years ago. Bunsen
kissed Merle; of course the polite Genevan could but return
the compliment. Great was the ado about the “kiss
of reconciliation,” as the Germans called it, much to the
annoyance of Dr. Merle, who had no idea of compromising
the solemn writers of theology by a kiss! Besides,
he said, he preferred the English custom in kissing
to the German. A delicate insinuation, that; but the

<p>In the famous Brooklyn trial, Tilton <i>versus</i> Beecher,
in which the world was favored with some extraordinary
revelations respecting the ethics and æsthetics of modern
osculation, the defendant, Mr. Beecher, while on the witness-stand,
testified to his singularly varied experiences.
In the course of his testimony, he said:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Moulton then came in; she came to me and
said, ‘Mr. Beecher, I don’t believe the stories they are
telling about you; I believe you are a good man.’ I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
looked up and said, ‘Emma Moulton, I am a good man;’
she then bent over and kissed me on the forehead; it was
a kiss of inspiration, but I did not think it proper to
return it.”</p>

<p>When subsequently asked what he meant by a kiss of
inspiration, he replied:</p>

<p>“I meant—well, it was a token of confidence; it was a
salutation that did not belong to the common courtesy of
life: neither was it a kiss of pleasure, or anything of that
kind, but it was, as I sometimes have seen it in poetry—if
you will excuse me—it was—it seemed to me, a holy
kiss.”</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> “You have said something about your not returning
it?”</p>

<p><i>A.</i> “Well, sir, I felt—I felt so deeply grateful that if
I had returned the kiss, I might have returned it with an
enthusiasm that would have offended her delicacy; it was
not best, under the circumstances, that she and I should
kiss.”</p>

<p>This led the newspapers to ask for the interpretation
of a kiss which Mr. Beecher had previously characterized
as “paroxysmal.” It was comparatively easy even for
people who were accustomed to do their kissing without
analysis to comprehend the other varieties which had
been introduced during the progress of the trial, such as
the impulsive kiss, the enthusiastic kiss, the holy kiss, the
kiss of reconciliation, the kiss of grace, mercy, and peace,
and the kiss mutual. But the kiss “inspirational” and
the kiss “paroxysmal” were likely to be understood only
by those who remembered the story of the good old
Methodist deacon. The young people of the church were
in the habit of playing games whose forfeits were kisses;
but the pious old gentleman was much troubled about it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
and said that he was not so much opposed to kissing if
they did not kiss <i>with an appetite</i>.</p>

<p>The Tilton-Beecher case evoked from the newspaper
writers an infinite amount of comment. Among those
whose views attracted marked attention was Mrs. Jane G.
Swisshelm, who said, in the Chicago “Tribune:”</p>

<p>“We can all see the impropriety of verbal declarations
of passion in such cases; and how much more unsafe any
act bearing such interpretation! Wherever men and
women meet in friendly or business relations, one or both
must be constantly mindful of the differences and dangers
of the sex,—must guard looks, words, and actions, and in
no moment of overwrought sympathy can the stern barriers
of decorum be safely broken down. Before kissing
Mr. Beecher, Mrs. Moulton should have waited until he
had taken that powder, until it had done its work and
the undertaker had the body ready for burial. Only in
his coffin is it safe for even ‘a section of the day of
judgment,’ in the shape of a woman, to kiss any one
man in a thousand. There seems to be no room for
doubt that she is, or was, a perfectly upright woman; but
her childish act shows the atmosphere in which these
men have been living,—shows the unconscious steps by
which they passed from virtue to vice,—and ought to
awaken all lovers of virtue to a more careful guard of her
outside defences. Chastity is not the natural condition
of the race, but the very opposite, and it can only be
secured by ages of culture and constant vigilance. It is a
something to be acquired and maintained through grace
and watchfulness, and those who open doors through
which the enemy enters and causes the fall of others
are responsible for their negligence and mistaken confidence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>This judgment brought out some humorous responses.
A lady thus expressed her indignation in the “Graphic:”</p>

<p>“I never saw Mrs. Swisshelm, thank goodness; but what
a perfectly ridiculous old creature she must be! According
to her own account, no live man could be found who
would venture to kiss her, and so she was obliged to go
and unscrew a dead man’s coffin and kiss him. I never
heard of anything so dreadful in the whole course of my
life.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Swisshelm’s letter is enough for me. I can
understand just what a dreadful old person she must
be. She wears trousers, I am told, besides that perfectly
preposterous garment, the ‘chemiloon.’ If I was a man,
I would no more kiss such a woman than I would kiss a
pair of tongs that had been left out over-night in a snowbank.</p>

<p>“Kissing, when done innocently, is as innocent as
strawberries-and-cream, and as nice. If Mrs. Swisshelm
could only grow young and pretty, and take off her
trousers and dress like a Christian, she would soon change
her mind about kissing. Her letter is the expression of
a cross old woman’s envious mind, and she ought to be
ashamed of herself.”</p>

<p>Another writer, who objected to such forcibly expressed
and sweeping opposition to kissing, said, in the
“Inter-Ocean:”</p>

<p>“We believe in temperance, but not in total abstinence,
so far as this business is concerned. Mrs. Swisshelm
takes credit to herself for carefully avoiding kisses during
her protracted life. To this she attributes, in part, her
longevity and general heartiness. In one instance only
did Mrs. Swisshelm deviate from this rule. It was in a
hospital. A poor boy had been suffering long and much,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
and she had visited and cared for him. One day when
she came in she found him dead and in his coffin. Then
the law was suspended for a moment, and, bending her
head, she kissed him, satisfied that he had passed beyond
the thrill of an unholy thought thereat. A moment after,
she bethought herself that others were in the room to
whom the kiss might prove unprofitable, and for a second
she upbraided herself for her foolish fervor; but an examination
proved that these fears were groundless, for the
others were dead also. This is the story as we gain it
second-hand. We do not sympathize with this sentiment.
If the poor boy needed a kiss at all, he needed it
before his life had gone out and left the body only a clog.
A kick or a kiss is equally unimportant to a piece of inanimate
clay. The fact that there may have been too
much kissing in high life of late years does not alter
the fact that osculatory salutes are very good things in
the family.”</p>

<p>The late Father Taylor, of the Seamen’s Bethel at
Boston, narrates the following incident:</p>

<p>“While in Palestine, I went out one evening, and sat
upon the grass on what was thought to be the hill Calvary.
I lay down, and, with my arms under my head,
looked up at the stars and meditated on what had happened
on that sacred spot. With pain I suddenly remembered
a man in my far-distant home who had always been
hostile to me. I felt that my feelings also had not been
right towards him, and I told my Lord that if I lived to
get home I would see that man and ask his forgiveness.
It was permitted me in due time to reach home. The
incident had faded from my mind, when, one day, walking
in Exchange Street, I saw that man approaching. My
old feeling returned. I passed him without a sign; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
just then I remembered Calvary, and turned to look after
him. To my surprise, he also was turning. I went back
to him, threw my arms about him, and kissed him! and
I felt better.”</p>

<p>Herr Hackländer, writing on the subject of osculation,
says:</p>

<p>“There are three kisses by which the human race are
blest: the first is that which the mother presses on the
new-born infant’s head; the second, that which the newly-wedded
bride bestows on your lips; the third, that with
which love or friendship closes your eyes when your
career is ended.”</p>

<p>After which rhetorical flourish he adds:</p>

<p>“But I, more blest than other mortals, have to boast
of a fourth kiss of bliss, that of Father Radetzky!”
Hackländer had written a description of the battle of
Novara, which brought him, among other distinctions, a
<i>kiss</i> from the old field-marshal.</p>

<p>Turning back to mediæval history, we find an amusing
incident in the career of Charles the Simple, of France.
The viking Rollo, having been banished from Norway by
Harold, proceeded southward to conquer a new domain.
Entering the mouth of the Seine, he took possession of
Rouen, where he spent the winter of each year, employing
the summer in ravaging France, till at last the king,
Charles the Simple, as the only hope of obtaining peace,
promised to give him the province of Neustria as a fief,
provided he would become a Christian.</p>

<p>Rollo was baptized at Rouen, in 912. He had then to
pay homage to King Charles by kneeling before him, kissing
his foot, and swearing to pay him allegiance. Rollo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
took the oath, but nothing would induce him to perform
the rest of the ceremony, and he appointed one of his
followers to do homage in his stead. The Northman, as
proud as his master, wilfully misunderstood, and, instead
of kneeling, lifted the king’s foot up to reach his mouth,
so as to upset king and throne together, amid the rude
laughter of his countrymen.</p>

<p>When the famous crusade of Godfrey de Bouillon,
early in the eleventh century, was nearing its successful
issue, Tancred, with a few other knights, was the first to
come in sight of Jerusalem. When the Crusaders beheld
the Holy City, the object of all their hopes and toils, they
all at once fell down on their knees, weeping and giving
thanks, and even kissing the sacred earth, and, as they
rose, hymns of praise were sung by the whole army. So
when Columbus and his followers stepped on the beach
of San Salvador, all knelt down, reverently kissing the
ground, with tears and thanks to God.</p>

<p>Jean Paul Frederic Richter, in his “Autobiography,”
thus describes a thrilling event in his life’s history:</p>

<h4>MY FIRST KISS.</h4>

<p>As earlier in life, on the opposite church-bench, so I
could but fall in love with Catharine Bärin, as she sat
always above me on the school-bench, with her pretty,
round, red, smallpox-marked face,—her lightning eyes,—the
pretty hastiness with which she spoke and ran. In
the school carnival, that took in the whole forenoon succeeding
fast nights, and consisted in dancing and playing,
I had the joy to perform the irregular hop dance, that
preceded the regular, with her. In the play, “<i>How does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
your neighbor please you?</i>” where upon an affirmative
answer they are ordered to kiss, and upon a contrary
there is a calling out, and in the midst of accolades all
change places, I ran always near her. The blows were
like gold-beaters’ by which the pure gold of my love was
beaten out, and a continual change of places, as she
always forbid me the court, and I always called her to
the court, was managed.</p>

<p>All these malicious occurrences (<i>desertiones malitiosæ</i>)
could not deprive me of the blessedness of meeting her
daily, when with her snow-white apron and her snow-white
cap she ran over the long bridge opposite the parsonage
window, out of which I was looking. To catch
her, not to <i>say</i>, but to <i>give</i> her something sweet, a mouthful
of fruit, to run quickly through the parsonage court,
down the little steps, and arrest her in her flight, my conscience
would never permit; but I enjoyed enough to see
her from the window upon the bridge, and I think it was
near enough for me to stand, as I usually did, with my
heart behind a long seeing and hearing trumpet. Distance
injures true love less than nearness. Could I upon the
planet Venus discover the goddess Venus, while in the
distance its charms were so enchanting, I should have
warmly loved it, and without hesitation chosen to revere
it as my morning and evening star.</p>

<p>In the mean time I have the satisfaction to draw all
those, who expect in Schwarzenbach a repetition of the
Joditz love, from their error, and inform them that it
came to something. On a winter evening, when my
princess’s collection of sweet gifts was prepared, and
needed only a receiver, the pastor’s son, who among all
my school companions was the worst, persuaded me, when
a visit from the chaplain occupied my father, to leave the
parsonage while it was dark, to pass the bridge, and venture,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
which I had never done, into the house where the
beloved dwelt with her poor grandmother up in a little
corner chamber. We entered a little ale-house underneath.
Whether Catharine happened to be there, or
whether the rascal, under the pretence of a message,
allured her down upon the middle of the steps, or, in
short, how it happened that I found her there, has become
only a dreamy recollection; for the sudden lightning
of the present darkened all that went behind. As
violently as if I had been a robber, I first pressed upon
her my present of sweetmeats, and then I, who in Joditz
never could reach the heaven of a first kiss, and never
even dared to touch the beloved hand, I, for the first
time, held a beloved being upon my heart and lips. I
have nothing further to say, but that it was the <i>one</i> pearl
of a minute, that was never repeated; a whole longing
past and a dreaming future were united in one moment,
and in the darkness behind my closed eyes the fireworks
of a whole life were evolved in a glance. Ah, I have
never forgotten it,—the ineffaceable moment!</p>

<p>I returned like a <i>clairvoyant</i> from heaven again to earth,
and remarked only that in this second Christmas festival
Ruprecht<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> did not precede, but followed it, for on my
way home I met a messenger coming for me, and was
severely scolded for running away. Usually after such
warm silver beams of a blessed sun there falls a closing,
stormy gust. What was its effect on me? The stream of
words could not drain my paradise,—for does it not
bloom even to-day around and forth from my pen?</p>

<p>It was, as I have said, the first kiss, and, as I believe,
will be the last; for I shall not, probably, although she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
lives yet, journey to Schwarzenbach to give a second.
As usual, during my whole Schwarzenbach life I was
perfectly contented with my telegraphic love, which yet
sustained and kept itself alive without any answering
telegram. But truly no one could blame her less than
I that she was silent at that time, or that she continues so
now after the death of her husband; for later, in stranger
loves and hearts, I have always been slow to speak. It
did not help me that I stood with ready face and attractive
outward appearance; all corporeal charms must be
placed over the foil of the spiritual before they can sufficiently
shine and kindle and dazzle. But this was the
cause of failure in my innocent love-time, that without
any intercourse with the beloved, without conversation or
introduction, I displayed my whole love bursting from the
dry exterior, and stood before her like the <i>Judas-tree</i>, in
full blossom, but without branch or leaf.</p>

<h3>FREAKS AND PHASES OF LOCAL CUSTOM.</h3>

<h4>THE KISS OF PEACE.</h4>

<p>The peculiar tendency of the Christian religion to encourage
honor towards all men, as men, to foster and
develop the softer affections, and, in the trying condition
of the early Church, to make its members intimately
known one to another, and unite them in the closest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
bonds, led to the observance of kissing as an accompaniment
of that social worship which took its origin in the
very cradle of our religion. Hence the exhortation of
St. Paul, “Salute one another with a holy kiss;” and the
brethren followed the injunction literally. It was called
<i>signaculum orationis</i>, the soul of prayer; and was a symbol
of that mutual forgiveness and reconciliation which
the Church required as an essential condition to admission
to its sacraments. Tertullian, Origen, and Athenagoras
mention it; and Dr. Milner cites the Apostolical Constitutions
to show the manner in which the ceremony was
performed:</p>

<p>“Let the bishop salute the church and say, ‘The peace
of God be with you all;’ And let the people answer,
‘And with thy spirit.’ Then let the deacon say to all,
‘Salute one another with a holy kiss and let the clergy
kiss the bishop, and the laymen the laymen, and the
women the women.”</p>

<p>This primitive fraternal embrace appears to have been
observed as late as the twelfth or thirteenth century, and
the <i>pax</i> (osculatorium, porte-paix, or pax brede) introduced,
as it was at this period that the sexes began to
mingle together in the low mass.</p>

<p>The use of the <i>pax</i> in England was prescribed by the
royal commissioners of Edward VI. The Injunctions
published at Doncaster, in 1548, ordain that:</p>

<p>“The clarke shall bring down the paxe, and standing
without the church door, shall say loudly to the people
these words, ‘This is a token of joyful peace which is
betwixt God and men’s conscience; Christ alone is the
peace-maker, which straitly commands peace between
brother and brother. And so long as ye shall use these
ceremonies, so long shall ye use these significations.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Agnes Strickland, in her account of the coronation
of Queen Elizabeth, says:</p>

<p>“Then the bishop began the mass, the epistle being
read first in Latin and then in English, the gospel the
same,—the book being sent to the queen, who kissed the
gospel. She then went to the altar to make her second
offering, three unsheathed swords being borne before her,
and one in the scabbard. The queen, kneeling, put
money in the basin, and kissed the chalice; and then and
there certain words were read to her grace. She retired
to her seat again during the consecration, and kissed the
pax.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<h4>ROYAL FEET-WASHING AND KISSING.</h4>

<p>In this country, the ceremonies of Lent and of Easter
belong to the Church alone, but in most other lands these
occasions have always borne both a civil and a political
relation to society.</p>

<p>In former times royalty itself led the Lenten solemnities,
and we read of monarchs washing the feet of beggars,
in imitation of Christ, who washed the feet of his disciples.
This ceremony, which was regularly practised by
the kings and queens of England in ancient times, occurred
upon Maundy-Thursday. They washed and kissed
the feet of as many poor people as they themselves numbered
in years, and bestowed a gift, or <i>maundy</i>, upon
each.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth performed this royal duty at Greenwich
when she was thirty-nine years old, on which occasion
the feet of thirty-nine poor persons were first washed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
by the yeomen of the laundry with warm water and sweet
herbs, afterwards by the sub-almoner, and lastly by the
queen herself; the person who washed making each time
a cross upon the pauper’s foot, above the toes, and kissing
it. This ceremony was performed by the queen
kneeling, being attended by thirty-nine ladies and gentlemen.
Clothes, victuals, and money were then distributed
among the poor.</p>

<p>The last of the English monarchs who performed this
office in person was James II., and it was afterwards performed
by the almoner. On the 5th of April, 1731, it
being Maundy-Thursday, and the king in his forty-eighth
year, there were distributed at the banqueting-house,
Whitehall, to forty-eight poor men and the same number
of poor women, boiled beef and shoulders of mutton,
and small bowls of ale, for dinner; after that large wooden
platters of fish and loaves, the fish being undressed,—twelve
red herrings and twelve white herrings, and four
half quartern loaves. Each person had one platter of
these provisions, and after that were distributed among
them shoes, stockings, linen and woollen cloth, and
leathern bags filled with silver and copper coins, to each
about four pounds in value. The washing of feet was
performed by his Grace the Lord Archbishop of York,
who was also Lord High Almoner.</p>

<p>Cardinal Wolsey, in 1530, made his <i>maundy</i> at Peterborough
Abbey, where upon Maundy-Thursday, in our
Lady’s Chapel, he washed and kissed the feet of fifty-nine
poor men, “and, after he had wiped them, he gave every
one of the said poor men twelve pence in money, three
ells of good canvas to make them shirts, a pair of new
shoes, a cast of red herrings and three white herrings,
and one of these had two shillings.”</p>

<p>This ancient custom is now no longer observed, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
in the Royal Chapel at Whitehall, where the poor still
receive their gifts from the royal bounty.</p>

<p>Soon after the accession of King Alfonso to the throne
of Spain, he performed the emblematic ceremony of
washing the apostles’ feet, showing that the royal custom
is not obsolete in Madrid, at least. A witness, after describing
the preliminaries, says:</p>

<p>“Men and women in a compact mass of silk and
velvet, broadcloth and gold lace, crowded the ‘Hall of
the Columns,’ where the ceremony was to take place, the
spectators, more than eight hundred of whom were ladies,
standing all round, jammed upon benches, row upon row,
leaving barely the most limited space open for the performers.
Within this space the twelve paupers, or apostles,
sat on a settee, each of them with his best foot and
leg bare to the knee, and as well ‘prepared’ for the
occasion as by dint of much soap and water could be
contrived; the king in his grand uniform, with a towel
tied around him, apron-wise, followed by Cardinal Moreno,
Archbishop of Valladolid, in his scarlet robes and
skull-cap, and behind and all around them a great staff of
grandees and marshals, an array of golden uniforms only
distinguishable from the no less sumptuous liveries of the
court menials by the stars, crosses, cordons, and scarfs of
their chivalrous orders. The cardinal went first, and
sprinkled a few drops of perfumed water over each of
the bare feet in succession; the king came after, kneeling
before each foot, rubbing it slightly with his towel, then
stooping upon it as if he meant to kiss it. The ceremony
did not take many minutes. The twelve men then got
up; they were marshalled in great pomp round the hall,
and seated in a row on one side of the table, with their
faces to the spectators, in the order observed in Leonardo
da Vinci’s grand picture of the Last Supper.”</p>

<h4>THE CUSTOM OF KISSING HANDS.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Solemnly down the street came the parish priest, and the children</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right"><i>Evangeline.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. D’Israeli, in his “Curiosities of Literature,” thus
summarizes the historical notices of M. Morin, a French
Academician, upon the custom of kissing hands:</p>

<p>“This custom is not only very ancient, and nearly universal,
but has been alike participated by religion and
society.</p>

<p>“To begin with religion. From the remotest times
men saluted the sun, moon, and stars, by kissing the
hand. Job assures us that he was never given to this
superstition (xxxi. 27). The same honor was rendered
to Baal (1 Kings xviii.). Other instances might be adduced.</p>

<p>“We now pass to Greece. There all foreign superstitions
were received. Lucian, after having mentioned
various sorts of sacrifices which the rich offered the gods,
adds that the poor adored them by the simpler compliment
of kissing their hands. That author gives an anecdote
of Demosthenes which shows this custom. When a
prisoner to the soldiers of Antipater, he asked to enter a
temple. When he entered, he touched his mouth with
his hands, which the guards took for an act of religion.
He did it, however, more securely to swallow the poison
he had prepared for such an occasion. Lucian mentions
other instances.</p>

<p>“From the Greeks it passed to the Romans. Pliny
places it amongst those ancient customs of which they
were ignorant of the origin or the reason. Persons were
treated as atheists who would not kiss their hands when
they entered a temple. When Apuleius mentions Psyche,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
he says she was so beautiful that they adored her as
Venus, in kissing the right hand.</p>

<p>“This ceremonial action rendered respectable the earliest
institutions of Christianity. It was a custom with the
primeval bishops to give their hands to be kissed by the
ministers who served at the altar.</p>

<p>“This custom, however, as a religious rite, declined
with paganism.</p>

<p>“In society our ingenious Academician considers the
custom of kissing hands as essential to its welfare. It is a
mute form which expresses reconciliation, which entreats
favors, or which thanks for those received. It is a universal
language, intelligible without an interpreter, which
doubtless preceded writing, and perhaps speech itself.</p>

<p>“Solomon says of the flatterers and suppliants of his
time, that they ceased not to kiss the hands of their patrons
till they had obtained the favors which they solicited. In
Homer we see Priam kissing the hands and embracing
the knees of Achilles while he supplicates for the body
of Hector.</p>

<p>“This custom prevailed in ancient Rome, but it varied.
In the first ages of the republic it seems to have been
only practised by inferiors to their superiors: equals gave
their hands and embraced. In the progress of time, even
the soldiers refused to show this mark of respect to their
generals; and their kissing the hand of Cato when he
was obliged to quit them was regarded as an extraordinary
circumstance, at a period of such refinement. The great
respect paid to the tribunes, consuls, and dictators obliged
individuals to live with them in a more distant and respectful
manner, and, instead of embracing them as they did formerly,
they considered themselves as fortunate if allowed
to kiss their hands. Under the emperors, kissing hands
became an essential duty, even for the great themselves;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
inferior courtiers were obliged to be content to adore the
purple by kneeling, touching the robe of the emperor by
the right hand, and carrying it to the mouth. Even this
was thought too free; and at length they saluted the emperor
at a distance by kissing their hands, in the same
manner as when they adored their gods.</p>

<p>“It is superfluous to trace this custom in every country
where it exists. It is practised in every known country,
in respect of sovereigns and superiors, even amongst the
negroes and inhabitants of the New World. Cortez
found it established at Mexico, where more than a thousand
lords saluted him, in touching the earth with their
hands, which they afterwards carried to their mouths.</p>

<p>“Thus, whether the custom of salutation is practised by
kissing the hands of others from respect, or in bringing
one’s own to the mouth, it is of all customs the most universal.
M. Morin concludes that this practice is now
become too gross a familiarity, and it is considered as a
meanness to kiss the hand of those with whom we are in
habits of intercourse; and he prettily observes that this
custom would be entirely lost if <i>lovers</i> were not solicitous
to preserve it in all its full power.”</p>

<p>The mistletoe, which has so many mystic associations
connected with it, is believed to be propagated in its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
natural state by the <i>missel-thrush</i>, which feeds upon its
berries. It was long thought impossible to propagate it
artificially; but this object has been attained by bruising
the berries, and, by means of their viscidity, causing them
to adhere to the bark of fruit-trees, where they readily
germinate and take root. The growth of the mistletoe
on the oak is now of extremely rare occurrence, but in
the orchards of the west-midland counties of England,
such as the shires of Gloucester and Worcester, the plant
flourishes in great frequency and luxuriance on the apple-trees.
Large quantities are annually cut at the Christmas
season, and despatched to London and other places,
where they are extensively used for the decoration of
houses and shops. The special custom connected with
the mistletoe on Christmas Eve, an indubitable relic
of the days of Druidism, handed down through a long
course of centuries, must be familiar to all of our readers.
A branch of the mystic plant is suspended from the wall
or ceiling, and any one of the fair sex who, either from
inadvertence, or, as possibly may be insinuated, <i>on purpose</i>,
passes beneath the sacred spray, incurs the penalty
of being then and there kissed by any lord of the creation
who chooses to avail himself of the privilege.</p>

<h4>SCANDINAVIAN TRADITION.</h4>

<p>Balder, the Apollo of Scandinavian mythology, was
killed by a mistletoe arrow given to the blind Höder by
Loki, the god of mischief, and potentate of our earth.
Balder was restored to life, but the mistletoe was placed
in future under the care of Friga, and was never again to
be an instrument of evil till it touched the earth, the
empire of Loki. Hence is it always suspended from ceilings.
And when persons of opposite sexes pass under it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
they give each other the kiss of peace and love, in the
full assurance that the epiphyte is no longer an instrument
of mischief.</p>

<h4>THE BLARNEY STONE.</h4>

<p>In the year 1602, when the Spaniards were inciting the
Irish chieftains to harass the English authorities, Cormac
MacCarthy held, among other dependencies, the castle
of Blarney, and had concluded an armistice with the
Lord-President on condition of surrendering this fort to
an English garrison. Day after day did his lordship look
for the fulfilment of the compact, while the Irish Pozzo
di Borgo, as loath to part with his stronghold as Russia to
relinquish the Dardanelles, kept protocolizing with soft
promises and delusive delays, until at last Carew became
the laughing-stock of Elizabeth’s ministers, and <i>Blarney
talk</i> proverbial.</p>

<p>A popular tradition attributes to the Blarney Stone the
power of endowing whoever kisses it with the sweet, persuasive,
wheedling eloquence so perceptible in the language
of the Cork people, and which is generally termed
<i>Blarney</i>. This is the true meaning of the word, and not,
as some writers have supposed, a faculty of deviating from
veracity with an unblushing countenance whenever it may
be convenient. The curious traveller will seek in vain
the <i>real</i> stone, unless he allows himself to be lowered from
the northern angle of the lofty castle, when he will discover
cover it about twenty feet from the top, with the inscription—<i>Cormac
MacCarthy fortis me fieri fecit, A.D. 1446</i>.</p>

<p>As the kissing of this would be somewhat difficult, the
candidate for Blarney honors will be glad to know that
at the summit, and within easy access, is another <i>real</i>
stone, bearing the date of 1703. A song published in
the “Reliques of Father Prout” contains an allusion to
this marvellous relic:</p>

<h4>KISSING THE POPE’S TOE.</h4>

<p>Buckle, in his “History of Civilization in England,”
says:</p>

<p>“Some questions had been raised as to the propriety
of kissing the Pope’s toe, and even theologians had their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
doubts touching so singular a ceremony. But this difficulty
has been set at rest by Matthew of Westminster, who
explains the true origin of this custom. He says that
formerly it was usual to kiss the hand of his Holiness,
but that towards the end of the eighth century a certain
lewd woman, in making an offering to the Pope, not only
kissed his hand, but also pressed it. The Pope,—his name
was Leo,—seeing the danger, cut off his hand, and thus
escaped the contamination to which he had been exposed.
Since that time, the precaution has been taken of kissing
the Pope’s toe, instead of his hand. And, lest any one
should doubt the accuracy of this account, the historian
assures us that the hand, which had been cut off five or
six hundred years before, still existed in Rome; and was
indeed a standing miracle, since it was preserved in the
Lateran in its original state, free from corruption. And,
as some readers might wish to be informed respecting the
Lateran itself, where the hand was kept, this also is considered
by the historian, in another part of his great work,
where he traces it back to the Emperor Nero. For it is
said that this wicked persecutor of the faith on one occasion
vomited a frog covered with blood, which he believed
to be his own progeny, and, therefore, caused it to be shut
up in a vault, where it remained hidden for some time.
Now, in the Latin language <i>latente</i> means hidden, and
<i>rana</i> means a frog; so that by putting these two words
together we have the origin of the Lateran, which, in
fact, was built where the frog was found.”</p>

<p>Punch, the London Charivari, who is no respecter of
persons, and who strikes right and left with unhesitating

<h5>THE BRONZE STATUE OF ST. PETER.</h5>

<p>In “Pen-Pictures of Europe,” Elizabeth Peake says,
speaking of St. Peter’s Church at Rome:</p>

<p>“In contrast with the beauty and grandeur of the
interior is the insignificant-looking bronze statue of what
they call St. Peter, seated in a chair of white marble.
Some one remarked that it had been in ancient times a
statue of Jupiter. ‘Jupiter,’ I exclaimed, ‘the Jupiter
of the old Romans? Never!’ While I stood wondering
at the unaccountable vagaries of mankind in general, and
of artists in particular, and of the meaning of the word
taste, several persons passed along and kissed the foot of
the statue, the toes of which are actually worn away with
kissing, and the big toe, what is left of it, looks bright as
gold....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>“Crowds of people were walking round in the nave,
looking at the pictures and statues; crowds stood at the
gate of the chapel, looking in through the gate and railing,
listening to the music; and all grades filed along by
the statue of St. Peter, kneeling, then rising and kissing
his toe. The peasants wiped off the toe with their hands
or sleeves, and then kissed it; others carefully wiped it
with their handkerchiefs both before and after kissing it.”</p>

<h4>A KISS FOR A VOTE.</h4>

<p>In a little work published in London in 1758, entitled
“A New Geographical and Historical Grammar,” we find
the following paragraph concerning bribery and kissing:</p>

<p>“The ladies may think it a hardship that they are
neither allowed a place in the Senate nor a voice in the
choice of what is called the representative of the nation.
However, their influence appears to be such in many instances
that they have no reason to complain. In boroughs
the candidates are so wise as to apply chiefly to the
wife.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> A certain candidate for a Norfolk borough kissed
the voters’ wives with guineas in his mouth, for which
he was expelled the House; and for this reason others,
I suppose, will be more private in their addresses to the
ladies.”</p>

<p>Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, gave Steel, the
butcher, a kiss for his vote nearly a century since; and
another equally beautiful woman, Jane, Duchess of Gordon,
recruited her regiment in a similar manner. Duncan
Mackenzie, a veteran of Waterloo, who died at Elgin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
Scotland, December, 1866, delighted in relating how he
kissed the duchess in taking the shilling from between
her teeth to become one of her regiment,—the Gordon
Highlanders, better known as the Ninety-second. The
old Scottish veteran of eighty-seven has not left one
behind him to tell the same tale about kissing the blue-eyed
duchess in the market-place of Duthill.</p>

<p>The late Daniel O’Connell hit upon a novel mode of
securing votes for the candidates he had named at a certain
election, which test, considering the constitutional
temperament of his countrymen, is said to have proved
effectual. He said, in reference to the unfortunate elector
who should vote against them, “Let no man speak to
him. <i>Let no woman salute him!</i>”</p>

<h4>FRENCH CHEAPENING AND DEGENERACY.</h4>

<p>Montaigne, speaking of the gradual debasement of the
custom in France in his time (1533-1592), says:</p>

<p>“Do but observe how much the form of salutation, particular
to our nation, has by its facility made kisses, which
Socrates says are so powerful and dangerous for stealing
hearts, of no esteem. It is a nauseous and injurious custom
for ladies, that they must be obliged to lend their lips
to every fellow that has three footmen at his heels, how
nasty or deformed soever; and we do not get much by the
bargain; for, as the world is divided, for three pretty
women we must kiss fifty ugly ones, and to a tender
stomach like those of my age, an ill kiss overpays a good
one.”</p>

<h4>KISSING DANCES.</h4>

<p>A correspondent of “The Spectator” (No. 67, an.
1711) having bitterly complained of the lascivious character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
of the dancing of the period, Budgell, in the course
of his reply, remarks:</p>

<p>“I must confess I am afraid that my correspondent had
too much reason to be a little out of humor at the treatment
of his daughter; but I conclude that he would have
been much more so had he seen one of those kissing
dances, in which Will Honeycomb assures me they are
obliged to dwell almost a minute on the fair one’s lips,
or they will be too quick for the music and dance quite
out of time.”</p>

<p>Long before, Sir John Suckling had said, in his “Ballad
on a Wedding:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O’ th’ sudden up they rise and dance;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then sit again, and sigh, and glance;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Then dance again, and kiss.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While on this subject it may not be amiss to advert to
a passage in the <i>Symposium</i>, or Banquet, of Xenophon,
which Burton, in his “Anatomy of Melancholy,” quotes
with his usual gusto:</p>

<p>“When Xenophon had discoursed of love, and used
all the engines that might be devised, to move Socrates,
among the rest, to stir him the more, he shuts up all with
a pleasant interlude or dance of Dionysius and Ariadne:
First Ariadne, dressed like a bride, came in and took
her place; by-and-by Dionysius entered, dancing to the
music. The spectators did all admire the young man’s
carriage; and Ariadne herself was so much affected with
the sight that she could scarce sit. After awhile Dionysius
beholding Ariadne, and incensed with love, bowing to
her knees, embraced her first, and kissed her with a grace;
she embraced him again, and kissed him with like affection,
as the dance required; but they that stood by and
saw this did much applaud and commend them both for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
it. And when Dionysius rose up, he raised her up with
him, and many pretty gestures, embraces, kisses, and love-compliments
passed between them: which when they saw
fair Bacchus and beautiful Ariadne so sweetly and so unfeignedly
kissing each other, so really embracing, they
swore they loved indeed, and were so inflamed with the
object that they began to rouse up themselves, as if they
would have flown. At the last, when they saw them still
so willingly embracing, and now ready to go to the bride-chamber,
they were so ravished with it that they that were
unmarried swore they would forthwith marry, and those
that were married called instantly for their horses, and
galloped home to their wives.’”</p>

<h4>KISSING HANDS IN AUSTRIA.</h4>

<p>Kissing the hand is a national custom in Austria. A
gentleman on meeting a lady of his acquaintance, especially
if she be young and handsome, kisses her hand.
On parting from her he again kisses her hand. In Vienna,
a young man who is paying his addresses to a young lady,
on taking his place at the supper-table around which the
family are seated, kisses the mother’s hand as well as the
hand of his affianced. It is very common to see a gentleman
kiss a lady’s hand on the street on meeting or
parting. If you give a beggar-woman a few coppers, she
either kisses your hand, or says, “I kiss your hand.”
The stranger must expect to have his hand kissed not only
by beggars, but by chambermaids, lackeys, and even by old
men. Gentlemen kiss the hands of married women as
well as of those who are single, as it is regarded as an
ordinary salutation or token of respect. American ladies
are startled with the first experience of the application of
this custom; but they soon submit to it with a good grace.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
Children, when presented to a stranger, take his hand
and kiss it, showing that it is a custom to which they are
educated from their cradles.</p>

<h4>TEMPLAR INTERDICTION.</h4>

<p>In “Ivanhoe” the Grand Master of the Templars is
made to say:</p>

<p>——“Thou knowest that we were forbidden to receive
those devout women who at the beginning were associated
as sisters of our Order, because, saith the forty-sixth
chapter, the Ancient Enemy hath by female society
withdrawn many from the right path to paradise. Nay,
in the last capital, being, as it were, the cope-stone which
our blessed founder placed on the pure and undefiled doctrine
which he had enjoined, we are prohibited from
offering even to our sisters and our mothers the kiss of
affection—<i>ut omnium mulierum fugiantur oscula</i>. I shame
to speak—I shame to think—of the corruptions which
have rushed in upon us even like a flood.”</p>

<h4>POMPEIAN TOKENS.</h4>

<p>Marc Monnier, in his “Wonders of Pompeii,” says
that the latest excavations have revealed the existence of
hanging covered balconies, long exterior corridors, pierced
with casements frequently depicted in the paintings.
There the fair Pompeian could have taken her station in
order to participate in the life outside. The good housewife
of those times, like her counterpart in our day, could
there have held out her basket to the street-merchant who
went wandering about with his portable shop; and more
than one handsome girl may at the same post have carried
her fingers to her lips, there to cull (the ancient custom)
the kiss that she flung to the young Pompeian concealed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
down yonder in the corner of the wall. Thus re-peopled,
the old-time street, narrow as it is, was gayer than our
own thoroughfares; and the brightly-painted houses, the
variegated walls, the monuments, and the fountains gave
vivid animation to a picture too dazzling for our gaze.</p>

<h4>ARABIAN SALUTATION.</h4>

<p>Eastern salutations take up considerable time. When
an Arab meets a friend, he begins, while yet some distance
from him, to make gestures expressive of his very
great satisfaction in seeing him. When he comes up to
him, he grasps him by the right hand, and then brings
back his own hand to his lips, in token of respect. He
next proceeds to place his hand gently under the long
beard of the other, and honors it with an affectionate
kiss. He inquires particularly, again and again, concerning
his health and the health of his family, and repeats,
over and over, the best wishes for his prosperity, giving
thanks to God that he is permitted once more to behold
his face. All this round of gestures and words is, of
course, gone over by the friend too, with like formality.
But they are not generally satisfied with a single exchange
of this sort: they sometimes repeat as often as ten times
the whole tiresome ceremony, with little or no variation.</p>

<p>Some such tedious modes of salutation were common,
also, of old; so that a man might suffer very material
delay in travelling if he chanced to meet several acquaintances
and should undertake to salute each according to
the custom of the country. On this account, when Elisha
sent his servant Gehazi in great haste to the Shunammite’s
house, he said to him, “If thou meet any man, salute
him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again.”
(2 Kings iv. 29.) So, when our Lord sent forth his
seventy disciples, among other instructions, he bade them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
“salute no man by the way;” meaning that their work
was too important to allow such a waste of time in the
exchange of mere unmeaning ceremonies. (Luke x. 4.)</p>

<h4>THE OLD ROMAN CODE.</h4>

<p>This code defined with great accuracy the nature,
limits, and conditions of the <i>right of kissing</i>, although we
do not find that property of this nature holds a place
among the incorporeal hereditaments of our laws. The
Romans were very strict, and only near blood-relations
might kiss the women of the family at all. The kiss had
all the virtue of a bond granted as a seal to the ceremony
of betrothing, in consequence of the violence done to
the modesty of the lady by a kiss!</p>

<h4>WEDDING-CEREMONY IN TURKEY.</h4>

<p>In Turkey, negotiations for marriage are conducted by
friends or relations, the parties in interest not being
allowed to see each other. The bargain being concluded
to their mutual satisfaction, preparations are made for the
customary festivities.</p>

<p>About nine or ten o’clock in the evening the nuptial
knot is tied,—the Imaam, or priest, placing himself in a
short passage which leads between two rooms, respectively
occupied by the bride and bridegroom, who neither see
each other nor the priest during the ceremony. That
functionary asks the bride if she will take the man to be
her husband, whether he be blind, lame, etc. She replies
yes, three times.</p>

<p>They are now man and wife, though as yet they have
not gazed on each other’s features.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the ceremony the festivities are
resumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the bride is escorted by her female friends
to the bridal chamber, where she is seated on an ottoman
and left alone. Shortly after, the bridegroom makes his
appearance. Discovering that his wife is still enveloped
in her veil, he requests her to throw it aside, so that he
can feast his eyes upon her beauty. This she coquettishly
declines doing until he has become very earnest in
his persuasions, when she discloses to him for the first
time a view of her face.</p>

<p>After much persuasion on his part, and affected reluctance
on hers, he at length succeeds in kissing her, and
the curtain drops.</p>

<h4>KISSING IN CHINA.</h4>

<p>An American naval officer, who had spent considerable
time in China, narrates an amusing experience of the
ignorance of the Chinese maidens of the custom of kissing.
Wishing to complete a conquest he had made of a
young <i>mei jin</i> (beautiful lady), he invited her—using the
English words—to give him a kiss. Finding her comprehension
of his request somewhat obscure, he suited the
action to the word and took a delicious kiss. The girl
ran away into another room, thoroughly alarmed, exclaiming,
“Terrible man-eater, I shall be devoured.”
But in a moment, finding herself uninjured by the salute,
she returned to his side, saying, “I would learn more of
your strange rite. Ke-e-es me.” He knew it wasn’t
“right,” but he kept on instructing her in the rite of
“ke-e-es me,” until she knew how to do it like a native
Yankee girl; and after all that, she suggested a second
course, by remarking, “Ke-e-es me some more, <i>seen jine</i>
Mee-lee-kee!” (<i>Anglicé</i>—American), and the lesson went
on until her mamma’s voice rudely awakened them from
their delicious dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the alleged infrequency of the custom
of kissing in the Chinese dominions, we learn, from the
Chinese poems which have been so happily translated by
Mr. G. C. Stent, that the people of far Cathay are quite
as susceptible to the spell of physical beauty as the people
of other lands, and that they know as well how to sing
and flatter it. Take the following extract, for example:</p>

<h4>NEW YEAR’S DAY IN NEW AMSTERDAM.</h4>

<p>In Diedrich Knickerbocker’s veracious history of New
York, we are told that New Year’s day was the favorite
festival of the renowned governor Peter Stuyvesant, and
was ushered in by the ringing of bells and firing of guns.
On that genial day, says Mr. Irving, the fountains of hospitality
were broken up, and the whole community was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
deluged with cherry brandy, true Hollands, and mulled
cider; every house was a temple of the jolly god, and
many a provident vagabond got drunk out of pure
economy,—taking in liquor enough gratis to serve him
half a year afterwards.</p>

<p>The great assemblage, however, was at the governor’s
house, whither repaired all the burghers of New Amsterdam,
with their wives and daughters, pranked out in their
best attire. On this occasion the good Peter was devoutly
observant of the pious Dutch rite of kissing the
women-kind for a Happy New Year; and it is traditional
that Antony the Trumpeter, who acted as gentleman
usher, took toll of all who were young and handsome,
as they passed through the antechamber. This venerable
custom, thus happily introduced, was followed with
such zeal by high and low that on New Year’s day, during
the reign of Peter Stuyvesant, New Amsterdam was
the most thoroughly be-kissed community in all Christendom.</p>

<p>The Trumpeter referred to by the humorous historian
was Van Corlear, of whom, on the eve of a famous Dutch
military campaign, it is said:</p>

<p>“It was a moving sight to see the buxom lasses, how they
hung about the doughty Antony Van Corlear,—for he was
a jolly, rosy-faced, lusty bachelor, fond of his joke, and
withal a desperate rogue among the women. Fain would
they have kept him to comfort them while the army was
away; for, besides what I have said of him, it is no more
than justice to add that he was a kind-hearted soul, noted
for his benevolent attentions in comforting disconsolate
wives during the absence of their husbands; and this made
him to be very much regarded by the honest burghers of
the city. But nothing could keep the valiant Antony
from following the heels of the old governor, whom he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
loved as he did his very soul; so, embracing all the
young vrouws, and giving every one of them that had
good teeth and rosy lips a dozen hearty smacks, he
departed, loaded with their kind wishes.”</p>

<p>Before leaving this lusty bachelor, who was such a
“prodigious favorite” with the women, it may be noted
that he is said to have been the first to collect that famous
toll levied on the fair sex at Kissing Bridge, on the highway
to Hellgate. The bridge referred to by Diedrich
still exists, but the toll is seldom collected nowadays,
except on sleighing-parties, by the descendants of the
patriarchs, who still preserve the traditions of the city.</p>

<h4>KISS-ME-QUICK.</h4>

<p>Bartlett, in his “Dictionary of Americanisms,” tells
us that the “Kiss-Me-Quick” is a home-made, quilted
bonnet, which does not extend beyond the face. It is
chiefly used to cover the head by ladies when going to
parties or to the theatre. Sam Slick says, in “Human
Nature:”</p>

<p>“She holds out with each hand a portion of her silk
dress, as if she was walking a minuet, and it discloses a
snow-white petticoat. Her step is short and mincing,
and she wears a new bonnet called a <i>kiss-me-quick</i>.”</p>

<h4>HUSKING-FROLICS.</h4>

<p>That early American poet, Joel Barlow, in his famous

the New England husking bees:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">A frolic scene, where work, and mirth, and play</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unite their charms to chase the hours away.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the huge heap lies centred in the hall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lamp suspended from the cheerful wall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brown, corn-fed nymphs, and strong, hard-handed beaux,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alternate ranged, extend in circling rows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assume their seats, the solid mass attack;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dry husks rustle, and the corn-cobs crack;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The song, the laugh, alternate notes resound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sweet cider trips in silence round.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The laws of husking every wight can tell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sure no laws he ever keeps so well:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For each red ear a general kiss he gains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With each smut ear he smuts the luckless swains;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when to some sweet maid a prize is cast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Red as her lips, and taper as her waist,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She walks the round and culls one favored beau,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who leaps the luscious tribute to bestow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Various the sports, as are the wits and brains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of well-pleased lasses and contending swains;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the vast mound of corn is swept away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he that gets the last ear wins the day.”</div>

<h4>TAKING TOLL AT THE BRIDGE.</h4>

<p>The old custom of “taking toll” has been humorously
commemorated by the Belgian artist Dillens, in a painting
of singular beauty. It was exhibited at the Paris International
Exhibition in 1855, and purchased by the late Emperor
of the French. The scene is in Zealand. A quiet
summer evening invites the peasantry of the country to a
stroll. Three couples, habited in Sunday or holiday costume,
have in their walks reached a bridge. Whether or
not it is a legal exaction that a toll must be enforced there,
is little to the purpose, but one of a peculiar character is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
demanded, and is most willingly paid by the first pair
who reach the spot: the buxom maiden, whose pleasant
upturned face shows she has no reluctance to submit to
the agreeable extortion, is quite as ready to pay the toll
as her lover is to take it. Of course the example will
be followed by their companions behind, though the two
young men pretend to be quite unconscious of what is
going on, and one of the females affects a look of surprise.</p>

<h4>A BRAVE ICELAND GIRL.</h4>

<p>Mr. Waller, in his interesting account of a visit to
Iceland in 1872, gives us a very clear idea of some of the
customs of the people, whom he found inconveniently
hospitable. Among other incidents, he relates the following
instance of native kindness and feminine courage:</p>

<p>“In the morning I made a small study, and, after a
very tolerable meal and many good wishes, we rode off.
All went well until we came to the river Markafljot, which
happened to be very much flooded. Not liking to attempt
to swim under the circumstances, we rode on down the
bank for some miles, and fortunately found a house.</p>

<p>“Knocking at the door, we asked, ‘Is the river very
deep?’</p>

<p>“‘Very,’ said a voice from the inside.</p>

<p>“‘Is there a man who will show us a ford?’ we asked
again.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ was the reply; ‘both Jan and Olave are up in
the mountains; but one of the girls will do quite as well.
Here, Thora, go and show the Englishmen the way.’</p>

<p>“Immediately an exceedingly handsome young woman
ran out, and, nodding kindly to me, went around to the
back of the house, caught a pony, put a bridle on it, and,
not taking the trouble to fetch a saddle, vaulted on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
bare back, and, sitting astride, drove her heels into its
sides and galloped off down the river-bank as hard as she
could go, shouting for us to follow.</p>

<p>“We became naturally rather excited at such a display
of dash on the part of such a pretty girl, and started off
immediately in chase. But, though we did our utmost to
catch her, she increased her distance hand over hand.
There was no doubt about it,—she had as much courage
as ever we could boast of, and in point of horsemanship
was a hundred yards ahead of either of us.</p>

<p>“For about half a mile we rattled along, when suddenly
she pulled up short on a sand-bank.</p>

<p>“‘You can cross here,’ she said, ‘but you must be
careful. Make straight for that rock right over there, and
when you have reached it you will be able to see the cairn
of stones we built to show the landing-place.’</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ I said. ‘Good-by.’</p>

<p>“She looked puzzled for a moment, and then said, ‘I’ll
come through with you: it will be safer.’</p>

<p>“‘Good gracious, Bjarni, don’t let her come!’ I said:
‘she is sure to be drowned, and I can’t get her out with
all those wet clothes on. Tell her to go back.’</p>

<p>“But before I was half-way through the sentence, she
had urged her horse into the water, and in a moment was
twenty yards into the river. Of course we followed as
quickly as possible, and after a great deal of splashing
reached the middle of the flood. ‘Now,’ she said,
bringing her horse up abreast with mine, and pointing
with her whip, ‘there’s the mark.’ The water was running
level with the horses’ withers, and it was only by
lifting their heads very high that they could keep their
noses clear.</p>

<p>“‘Good-by,’ she said; ‘God bless you,’ and, before I
was quite aware of it, kissed me on the cheek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>“I was about to return the compliment, but she was
gone; and, a few minutes after, we saw her, a mere speck
in the distance, galloping over the plain.</p>

<p>“Kissing in Iceland is a custom similar to shaking
hands here. I would have expected it in ordinary situations
but a kiss in the midst of boundless waters was, to
say the least of it, strange. It was certainly the wettest
one I ever had in my life.”</p>

<h4>PARAGUAYAN COMPULSION.</h4>

<p>“Everybody in Paraguay smokes,” says a South American
traveler, “and every female above the age of thirteen
chews. I am wrong. They do not chew, but put tobacco
in their mouths, keep it there constantly, except
when eating, and, instead of chewing it, roll it about
and suck it. Imagine yourself about to salute the red
lips of a magnificent little Hebe, arrayed with satin and
flashing with diamonds, as she puts you back with one
delicate hand, while with the other she draws forth from
her mouth a brownish-black roll of tobacco quite two
inches long, looking like a monster grub, and then, depositing
the savory lozenge on the brim of your sombrero,
puts up her face and is ready for a salute. I have
sometimes seen an over-delicate foreigner turn away with a
shudder of loathing under such circumstances, and get the
epithet of ‘the savage!’ applied to him by the offended
beauty for his sensitive squeamishness. However, one
soon gets used to this in Paraguay, where you are, perforce
of custom, obliged to kiss every lady you are introduced
to, and one-half you meet are really tempting
enough to render you regardless of the consequences, and
you would sip the dew of the proffered lip in the face of
a tobacco-factory,—even in the double-distilled honeydew
of Old Virginia.”</p>

<h4>A NEW YORK DRUMMER’S PREDICAMENT.</h4>

<p>At Big Creek, Arkansas, they have a peculiar fashion,
which sometimes proves embarrassing. As there is no
preacher within thirty miles, the way for marrying is by
kissing across a table. Recently, a New York drummer
who was there on business put up at a private house, and
became quite intimate with the inmates. One evening he
was fooling around one of the girls, and trying the sweetness
of her temper, when she gave his whiskers a pull and
ran. He followed. She got the table between them.
He chased her around it several times. When out of
breath, he stopped on the other side, and, making a wild
plunge, caught her in his arms and gave her a hearty
kiss. She then sat down on the sofa, and they talked
pleasantly for a couple of hours,—he thinking it singular
that she should sit up so late.</p>

<p>At last she said, “Don’t you think it’s about time we
went to bed?”</p>

<p>“I guess you are right,” he remarked; “let’s go.”</p>

<p>She lit a candle, and he was about to do the same,
when she said, “I reckon one’s enough. One candle will
light two folks to bed.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly it would, when those two people occupy
the same room. But your candle won’t illuminate my
chamber.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t we going to occupy the same room? Ain’t we
married?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t we what?” shouted the gentleman.</p>

<p>“Married! Didn’t you kiss me across the table?
That married us.”</p>

<p>A cold sweat spread over the drummer. He saw in an
instant that if he said he wasn’t married to her she would
make an outcry, and then her loving and much-tobacco-consuming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
father would arise in his wrath and carve him
into cutlets, and her brothers would bring down their
shot-guns and empty the contents into him. He must be
strategic. He must put her off. So he said:</p>

<p>“Fairest of your sex, permit me to remark that I did
not know that kissing across the table constituted a marriage-ceremony.
But I am content. I have never seen
one who so completely filled my idea of a beautiful, sweet,
loving, and modest woman. However, I would never
think of holding you to this marriage until I had asked
the permission of your father to pay my addresses to you.
To-morrow, at dinner, when the entire family are present,
I will propose for your fair hand.”</p>

<p>This satisfied the lady, and, after bestowing upon him
a fervent kiss, she went to her room, and he went to his.
He packed his carpet-bag, took off his boots, and made
tracks for the nearest railroad-station. He didn’t feel
entirely safe until he had reached St. Louis. He hasn’t
informed his wife of this little adventure. He’s afraid
she might write out to Arkansas for the facts in the case,
and then he might get arrested for bigamy. Women
sometimes won’t listen to reason, you know.</p>

<h4>A DANGEROUS GAME.</h4>

<p>“Drop the handkerchief” is a dangerous game. Desdemona
dropped her handkerchief, and it cost her her
life. Handkerchiefs have played a great deal of mischief.
A handkerchief ruptured a Baptist church in Dedham,
Mass. There was a church sociable in the chapel, and
they “played plays,” and “drop the handkerchief” was
one of the plays. We don’t remember just how it’s done,
but they stand in a circle, promiscuously, and a lady,
taking a handkerchief, walks around on the outside of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
circle and drops the handkerchief behind one of the male
persuasion, and he runs after her, or he don’t—we forget
which—but, any way, if he catches her, or if he don’t—we
forget which—he can kiss her. There is kissing about
it, any way, whether he catches her or not, for “drop the
handkerchief” would be no play with kissing left out.
And “drop the handkerchief” is a real play, and when
grown-up people play, kissing is the main part. So we
know there is kissing in it; and the account of this Dedham
affair says “the game involves kissing,” to which
the Rev. Mr. Foster, pastor, took exception, and he declared
“right out loud” that the “church was built for a
house of God, and not for kissing-parties.” And one of
the young men who was “involved” in the kissing-party
even threatened to smite the parson, and the account says
“the pleasure of the evening was destroyed,” and the
Rev. Mr. Foster resigned his charge.</p>

<h4>A QUESTION OF TASTE.</h4>

<p>The Dunkards, at their national convention at Girard,
Ill., discussed whether white members were bound to
salute colored ones with the holy kiss. After mature deliberation,
it was decided to be a matter of taste merely,
and that, while those who chose to indulge in universal
osculation, irrespective of race or color, should have full
liberty to do so, no member should feel himself obliged
to follow such example. The decision doubtless, it is said,
lightened many anxious hearts. The Dunkards, or German
Baptists, wear broad-brimmed hats, and fasten their
shad-belly coats close up to the throat; wear no neck-ties,
and never waste time in blacking their boots; consider
buttons too much like jewelry, and tie up their clothes
with strings; live frugally, and eschew cakes and sweets;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
work much, and spend little; never are wealthy, and yet
have no poor among them; kiss promiscuously in public,
and have no jealousies; never give the first word, and
never answer back; regard ancient customs, and disregard
the new; never hold office, and never take contracts.</p>

<h4>THE LATTER-DAY KISS OF PEACE.</h4>

<p>The members of the United Brethren Church, or
“Church of God,” in Pennsylvania, observe the sacrament
of feet-washing inculcated in the thirteenth chapter
of St. John’s Gospel. The ceremony is thus described
by a Pittsburg reporter:</p>

<p>“The front seats were entirely filled by men and
women who desired to take part in the ceremony. The
females, however, largely preponderated, and of both
sexes there were probably twenty-five or thirty. The
pastor partially filled two basins with water. The feet-washing
was done by a man and woman, each of whom
wore an apron in imitation of the girdle worn by Christ,
and each, taking up a basin of water, washed one by one
the feet of those of their own sex, the shoes and stockings
as a matter of course having been taken off. Both feet were
placed in the basin, and upon being taken out were wiped
with the apron worn by the washer, whereupon the one
performing the ceremony and the one submitting to it
shook hands and kissed each other, there being no distinction
at all made in the matter of sex, the men kissing
each other as well as the women. While this peculiar
ordinance was being attended to, the audience manifested
the most eager and intense interest. People crowded
forward in the aisles to get a good look at it, and so great
was the curiosity of those occupying the back seats that
many stood up on the benches for the purpose of getting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
a better view. During the performance of the ceremony
the congregation sang, with unusual vigor,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘This is the way I long have sought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mourned because I found it not.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4>NATIONAL DIFFERENCES.</h4>

<p>An eminent English authoress was leaving an afternoon
concert in London, when two old ladies from the country,
finding that she was the writer of books that had delighted
them, rushed up to her and begged permission to kiss her
hand. The authoress blushed deeply, and began tugging
at her tight-fitting glove. The glove was only withdrawn
after a minute or two of effort, causing much embarrassment
to the modest authoress. A French gentleman, who
had witnessed the proceeding, remarked that if it had been
George Sand she would instantly have thrown her arms
around the old women and kissed each on both cheeks.</p>

<h4>DETECTIVE UTILITY.</h4>

<p>Some ungallant writers assert that in the desire of the
ancients to test the sobriety of their wives and daughters,
who it seems were apt to make too free with the juice of
the grape, notwithstanding a prohibition to the contrary,
originated a practice reprobated by Socrates the philosopher,
Cato the elder, and Ambrose the saint, and lauded
by lyrists and lovers from the beginning of time. The
refinement of manners among the classic dames and damsels
before mentioned was probably pretty much upon a
par with that depicted in the “Beggars’ Opera,” when
Macheath exclaims, after saluting Jenny Diver, “One
may know by your kiss that your gin is excellent.”</p>

<h3>PLATONIC KISSES.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“What are they?” birdie, do you ask?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Your forehead wears a puckered line,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! now you’ve found a dreadful task</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Even for a learnèd head like mine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some questions are so hard! Ah, well,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">If even Plato’s self were here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sage, I fancy, could not tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The riddle that you ask me, dear.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My birdie, Plato was a sage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The first to find he had a soul;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The life we live from youth to age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His wisdom taught, was not the whole</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Through stern dominion of the mind.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And love, my birdie, Plato said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Should be communion of the soul,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And intellect should rule the whole.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each soul another soul might find,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And those you give me back again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Repeated oft, and never done;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not thus, I fancy, could it be</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Platonic brides were ever won.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Philosophy, perhaps, had charms</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Indifferent to his lady’s arms,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Two heads bent o’er one musty page.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But moderns, made of sterner stuff,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Would clothe it with a gentler light,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Don’t shake the one that drives the quill.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let Plato crown his love with bays,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I’ll make you mistress of my life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll love you, birdie, all my days,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And crown you with the name of wife.</div>

<p>[Before closing this portion of our selections, it is worth while to note
the popular misconception of the favorite ditty “Coming through the
Rye,” as shown in the pictorial illustrations which present a laddie and
lassie meeting and kissing in a field of grain. The lines,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If a laddie meet a lassie</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comin’ thro’ the rye,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and especially the other couplet,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A’ the lads they smile on me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When comin’ thro’ the rye,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">seem to imply that traversing the rye was a habitual or common thing;
but what in the name of the Royal Agricultural Society could be the object
in trampling down a crop of grain in that style? The song, perhaps,
suggests a harvest-scene, where both sexes, as is the custom in Great
Britain, are at work reaping, and where they would come and go through
the field indeed, but not through the rye itself, so as to meet and kiss in
it. The truth is, the rye in this case is no more grain than Rye Beach is,
it being the name of a small shallow stream near Ayr, in Scotland, which,
having neither bridge nor ferry, was forded by the people going to and
from the market, custom allowing a lad to steal a kiss from any lass of
his acquaintance whom he met in mid-stream. Reference to the first
verse, in which the lass is shown as wetting her clothes in the stream,
confirms this explanation:</p>

<h4>THE “BASIA” OF JOHANNES SECUNDUS.</h4>

<p>The true name of the Dutch poet Johannes Secundus
was Johannes Everard. He was born at the Hague in
1511, and died at Utrecht in 1536. His “Opera Poetica”
consist of elegies, odes, epigrams, and other poems,
written in purely classical Latin. Of these productions,
the “Basia,” or “Kisses” (Utrecht, 1539), have been
most admired, and have been ranked with the lyrics
of Catullus. They have been repeatedly translated into
the principal European languages, the English versions
being by Nott and Stanley. We offer selections from the
latter, for such of our readers as are unfamiliar with the
rapturous Dutchman’s florid effusions.</p>

<p>The introductory epigram is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lycinna scorns my <span class="smcap">Kisses</span>; they are chaste,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not stout enough for her experienced taste;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Ælia calls me “bard with languid strings,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She that to Love in streets her offerings brings.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps my utmost strength they seek to know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To prove my vigor!—Go! vile wantons, go!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My strength, my vigor, long despair to find;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For you these <span class="smcap">kisses</span> never were designed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Never for you were these soft measures wrought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Read me, ye tender brides of boys untaught;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Read me, of brides untaught ye tender boys,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet new to Venus’ sweetly varying joys!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Now round this orb, soft-floating on the air,</div>

<h3>EIGHTEENTH- AND NINETEENTH-CENTURY NOVELS.</h3>

<p>It is contended by an American humorist, in an argument
in favor of osculation, that it would imply a great
want of reverence in us if we were to set ourselves up as
wiser than our ancestors, and refuse to continue a practice
that has been sanctioned by their approval. Yet, if
we follow the curious aberrations in the extent of favor
accorded to it by these ancestors during the last century,
we shall be somewhat puzzled over the reflex as we find it
in the novels of different periods. With the exception
of Richardson, however, it must be owned that the eighteenth-century
novelists, from Fielding and Smollett down
to the time of the appearance of Goldsmith, and Maria
Edgeworth, and Jane Austen, prove the truth of the remark
of Shaw (“History of English Literature”) that “the
time when Fielding wrote was remarkable for the low tone
of manners and sentiment; perhaps the lowest that ever
prevailed in England, for it was precisely a juncture when
the romantic spirit of the old chivalrous manners was extinguished,
and before the modern standard of refinement
was introduced.” Accordingly, in Fielding and Smollett
the heroes and heroines kiss with all the gusto of a coarse
and licentious age, and without waiting for the interesting
time which the novelists of our day select for granting the
first long kiss of affection. The readers of Fielding’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
“Amelia” will remember the insulting young nobleman
who, upon meeting the heroine at Vauxhall, cries out,
“Let the devil come as soon as he will, d——n me if I
have not a kiss.”</p>

<p>In singular contrast with such athletic and boisterous
rudeness are the overwrought refinement and strained sentiment
of Richardson, Fielding’s contemporary and sometime
friend. In the one it is an outbreak of coarseness
or ungoverned passion; in the other it is a ceremonial
whose observance is attended with decorum and solemnity.
As a consequence, there is a great deal of the “naughty
but nice” fascination in the former, and a large proportion
of tedious and mawkish twaddle in the latter. For a
specimen of Richardson’s namby-pambyism we may advert
to his “Sir Charles Grandison,” in which we are told
that after leaving Italy and returning to England Sir
Charles solicits the hand of Harriet Byron in true Grandisonian
manner. It is amusing to see the lofty style in
which this mirror of chivalry makes love, and to note the
extravagance of his compliments. But let Miss Byron tell
the story:</p>

<p>“‘There seems,’ said he, ‘to be a mixture of generous
concern and kind curiosity in one of the loveliest and most
intelligent faces in the world.’”</p>

<p>“‘Thus,’ resumed he, snatching my hand and ardently
pressing it with his lips, ‘do I honor to myself for the
honor done me. How poor is man, that he cannot express
his gratitude to the object of his vows for obligations
confessed, but by owing to her new obligations!’”
[What a formal pedant of a lover!]</p>

<p>“In a soothing, tender, and respectful manner, he put
his arm round me, and, taking my own handkerchief, unresisted,
wiped away the tears as they fell on my cheek.
‘Sweet humanity! charming sensibility! check not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
kindly gush. Dew-drops of heaven! (wiping away my
tears and kissing the handkerchief)—dew-drops of heaven,
from a mind like that heaven, mild and gracious.’</p>

<p>“He kissed my hand with fervor; dropped down on
one knee; again kissed it. ‘You have laid me, madam,
under everlasting obligations; and will you permit me
before I rise, loveliest of women, will you permit me to
beg an early day?’”</p>

<p>“He clasped me in his arms with an ardor that displeased
me not on reflection, but at the time startled me.
He thanked me again on one knee; I held out the hand
he had not in his, with intent to raise him, for I could not
speak. He received it as a token of favor; kissed it with
ardor; arose, <i>again</i> pressed my cheek with his lips. I
was too much surprised to repulse him with anger. But
was he not too free? Am I a prude, my dear?”</p>

<p>Yes, Miss Byron, we are afraid you are a prude, to
feel such surprise and doubt at an innocent kiss after a
formal engagement.</p>

<p>By way of another contrast we copy the following passages:
In the “Unhappy Mistake” of Mrs. Behn (Astræa),
a lover, who is about to fight a duel, goes early in the morning
to his sister’s bedroom, with whom Lucretia, the mistress
of his affections, is sleeping. “They both happened
to be awake and talking as he came to the door, which his
sister permitted him to unlock, and asked him the reason
of his so early rising, who replied that since he could not
sleep he would take the air a little. ‘But first, sister,’
continued he, ‘I will refresh myself at your lips.’ ‘And
now, madam,’ added he to Lucretia, ‘I would beg a cordial
from you.’ ‘For that,’ said his sister, ‘you shall be
obliged to me for once.’ Saying so, she gently turned
Lucretia’s face toward him, and he had his wish. Ten to
one but he had rather have continued with Lucretia than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
have gone to her brother, had he known him, for he loved
her truly and passionately. But, being a man of true
courage and honor, he took his leave of them, presently
dressed, and tripped away with the messenger, who made
more than ordinary haste.”</p>

<p>As an offset to this, we recur to the story of “Sir Charles
Grandison.” In proof of the “humorous character” of
Charlotte Grandison, we are told that soon after her marriage
her husband made her a present of some old china.
“And when he had done,” writes she to Harriet Byron,
“taking the <i>liberty</i>, as he phrased it, half fearful, half
resolute, to salute his bride for his reward, and then pacing
backwards several steps with such a strut and crow—I see
him yet,—indulge me, Harriet!—I burst into a hearty
laugh; I could not help it; and he, reddening, looked
round himself and round himself to see if anything was
amiss on his part. The <i>man</i>, the <i>man</i>, honest friend,—I
could have said, but had too much reverence for my husband,—is
the oddity; nothing amiss in the garb.”</p>

<p>It is remarkable, says Forsyth, that some of the most
immoral novels in the English language should have been
written by women. This bad distinction belongs to Mrs.
Behn, Mrs. Manley, and Mrs. Heywood. <i>Corruptio optimi
est pessima</i>, and that such corrupt stories as they gave to
the world were the offspring of female pens is an unmistakable
proof of the loose manners of the age. It is
impossible, without the risk of offence, to quote freely
from the works of an age when vice and indelicacy were
triumphant and modesty had left its last footsteps upon
earth.</p>

<p>It is refreshing to pass from their details of profligacy,
and the insidious mischief of their assaults upon domestic
purity, to that later school of fiction which, as Lord Bacon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
says, “serveth and conformeth to magnanimity, morality,
and delectation.” Foremost among those at the
dawn of the present century, whose ideals are framed
according to the healthful and ennobling standards which
conform to the government and will of God and which
command the reverence of man, was Miss Jane Porter.
If her heroes are paragons like Grandison, they are not,
like Sir Charles, models of solemn foppery, insipid in
their superiority, correct as automata in their elaborate
politeness, or passing their lives, as Taine says, “in weighing
their duties and making salutations.” They are quite
as irreproachable, while they are far more consistent with
the conditions of our human nature and our human life.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to trace the course of Sobieski,
in “Thaddeus of Warsaw,” from the time when, as an
enforced exile, he dropped on his knees and, “plucking a
turf of grass and pressing it to his lips, exclaimed, ‘Farewell,
Poland! farewell all my hopes of happiness!’” to
the hour when he clasped his newly-wedded wife at the
grave of Butzou. But two extracts will suffice to show
what manner of man he was. Upon reading for the third
time a letter from Lady Tinemouth containing assurances
of Miss Beaufort’s high regard for him, his heart throbbed
with violent emotion:</p>

<p>“‘Delicious poison!’ cried he, kissing the paper. ‘If
adoring thee, lovely Mary, be added to my other sorrows,
I shall be resigned. There is sweetness even in the thought.
Could I credit all that my dear Lady Tinemouth affirms,
the conviction that I possess one kind solicitude in the
mind of Miss Beaufort would be ample compensation
for——’</p>

<p>“He did not finish the sentence, but, sighing profoundly,
rose from his chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“‘For anything, except beholding her the wife of
another!’ was the sentiment with which his heart panted.
Thaddeus had never known a selfish feeling in his life;
and this first instance of his wishing that good unappropriated
which he might not himself enjoy, made him start.</p>

<p>“‘There is a fault in my heart, a dreadful one!’ Dissatisfied
with himself, he was preparing to answer her
ladyship’s letter, when,” etc.</p>

<p>When the infatuated and distracted Lady Sara had
failed in her desperate efforts to entice Sobieski from
the path of honor and virtue in his own lodgings, he
pityingly and forgivingly attended her to her own home,
where, we are told:</p>

<p>“When Thaddeus had seated Lady Sara in her drawing-room,
he prepared to take a respectful leave; but her
ladyship, getting up, laid one hand on his arm, whilst with
the other she covered her convulsive features, and said,
‘Constantine, before you go, before we part, perhaps
eternally, oh, tell me that you do not hate me! That
you do not <i>hate</i> me!’ repeated she, in a firmer tone; ‘I
know too well how deeply I am despised!’</p>

<p>“‘Cease, my dearest madam,’ returned he, tenderly
replacing her on the sofa, ‘cease these vehement expressions.
Shame does not depend on possessing passions,
but on yielding to them. You have conquered,
Lady Sara, and in future I shall respect and love you as a
dear friend. Whoever holds the first place in my heart,
you shall always retain the second.’</p>

<p>“‘Noble, generous Constantine!’ cried she, straining
his hand to her lips and bathing it with her tears; ‘I
can require no more. May Heaven bless you wherever
you go.’</p>

<p>“Thaddeus dropped upon his knee, imprinted on both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
her hands a compassionate and fervent kiss, and, rising
hastily, quitted the room without a word.”</p>

<p>In the novels of our day, kissing is as indispensable
an adjunct to love-making as it ever was, but its treatment
has changed as the æsthetic and practical views of
courtship have changed with the influences of society.
Whether as the impulse of passionate attachment or the
expression of refined affection, it is, for the most part,
handled by our modern writers in a healthful, natural,
legitimate, decorous, and felicitous manner. Those who
indulge in namby-pamby effusion or sentimental gush,
on the one hand, or the startling aberrations and obliquities
of inconventionalism on the other, may expect to
hear from the satirists and reviewers. No one entertained
for weakly sentimentalism or affected prettiness
more profound contempt and impatience than Thackeray.
Yet where shall we find more exquisite touches than those
which abound in the pages of the great humorist and
satirist? Take, for example, a few scattered passages
from “The Newcomes:”</p>

<p>“There she sits; the same, but changed: as gone from
him as if she were dead; departed indeed into another
sphere, and entered into a kind of death. If there is no
love more in yonder heart, it is but a corpse unburied.
Strew round it the flowers of youth. Wash it with tears
of passion. Wrap it and envelop it with fond devotion.
Break heart, and fling yourself on the bier, and kiss her
cold lips, and press her hand! It falls back dead on the
cold breast again. The beautiful lips have never a blush
or a smile.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“He took a little slim white hand and laid it down on his
brown palm, where it looked all the whiter: he cleared the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
grizzled mustachio from his mouth, and, stooping down,
he kissed the little white hand with a great deal of grace
and dignity. There was no point of resemblance, and
yet a something in the girl’s look, voice, and movements,
which caused his heart to thrill, and an image out of the
past to rise up and salute him.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“The sisters-in-law kissed on meeting, with that cordiality
so delightful to witness in sisters who dwell together
in unity.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“He would not even stop and give his Ethel of old days
his hand. I would have given him I don’t know what,
for one kiss, for one kind word; but he passed on and
would not answer me.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“For months past they had not had a really kind word.
The tender old voice smote upon Clive, and he burst into
sudden tears. They rained upon his father’s trembling old
brown hand as he stooped down and kissed it.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Clive felt the pathetic mood coming on again, and an
immense desire to hug Lady Ann in his arms and to kiss
her. How grateful are we—how touched a frank and
generous heart is—for a kind word extended to us in our
pain!”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“The lips of the pretty satirist who alluded to these
unpleasant bygones were silenced, as they deserved to be,
by Mr. Pendennis. ‘Do you think, sir, I did not know,’
says the sweetest voice in the world, ‘when you went
out on your fishing excursions with Miss Amory?’ Again
the flow of words is checked by the styptic previously
applied.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“‘Oh, Pen,’ says my wife, closing my mouth in a way
which I do not choose further to particularize, ‘that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
man is the best, the dearest, the kindest creature. I
never knew such a good man; you ought to put him into
a book. Do you know, sir, that I felt the very greatest
desire to give him a kiss when he went away? and that
one which you had just now was intended for him?’”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Laura drove to his lodgings, and took him a box, which
was held up to him, as he came to open the door to my
wife’s knock, by our smiling little boy. He patted the
child on his golden head and kissed him. My wife wished
he would have done as much for her; but he would not,—though
she owned she kissed his hand. He drew it
across his eyes and thanked her in a very calm and stately
manner.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“On the day when he went away, Laura went up and
kissed him with tears in her eyes. ‘You know how
long I have been wanting to do it,’ this lady said to her
husband.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“She fairly gave way to tears as she spoke; and for me,
I longed to kiss the hem of her robe, or anything else she
would let me embrace, I was so happy, and so touched by
the simple demeanor and affection of the noble young
lady.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Ethel walked slowly up to the humble bed, and sat
down on a chair near it. No doubt her heart prayed for
him who slept there; she turned round where his black
Pensioner’s cloak was hanging on the wall, and lifted up
the homely garment and kissed it. The servant looked on,
admiring, I should think, her melancholy and her gracious
beauty.”</p>

<p>From Thackeray to Charles Dickens the transition is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
easy and pleasant. The difficulty, in both cases, is to
limit the number of our extracts. These are from “Nicholas
Nickleby:”</p>

<p>“It was very little that Nicholas knew of the world, but
he guessed enough about its ways to think that if he gave
Miss La Creevy one little kiss, perhaps she might not be
the less kindly disposed towards those he was leaving behind.
So he gave her three or four with a kind of jocose
gallantry, and Miss La Creevy evinced no greater symptoms
of displeasure than declaring, as she adjusted her
yellow turban, that she had never heard of such a thing,
and couldn’t have believed it possible.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“‘Do you remember the boy that died here?’</p>

<p>“‘I was not here, you know,’ said Nicholas, gently;
‘but what of him?’</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ replied the youth, drawing closer to his questioner’s
side, ‘I was with him at night, and when it was
all silent he cried no more for friends he wished to come
and sit with him, but began to see faces round his bed
that came from home; he said they smiled, and talked to
him; and he died at last lifting his head to kiss them.’”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“‘Oh, uncle, I am <i>so</i> glad to see you!’ said Mrs. Kenwigs,
kissing the collector affectionately on both cheeks.
‘So glad!’</p>

<p>“Now, this was an interesting thing. Here was a collector
of water-rates, without his book, without his pen
and ink, without his double knock, without his intimidation,
kissing—actually kissing—an agreeable female, and
leaving taxes, summonses, notices that he had called, or
announcements that he would never call again, for two
quarters’ due, wholly out of the question. It was pleasant
to see how the company looked on, quite absorbed in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
sight, and to behold the nods and winks with which they
expressed their gratification at finding so much humanity
in a tax-gatherer.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“‘Mr. Nicholas!’ cried Miss La Creevy, starting in
great astonishment.</p>

<p>“‘You have not forgotten me, I see,’ replied Nicholas,
extending his hand.</p>

<p>“‘Why, I think I should even have known you if I had
met you in the street,’ said Miss La Creevy, with a smile.
‘Hannah, another cup and saucer. Now, I’ll tell you
what, young man; I’ll trouble you not to repeat the impertinence
you were guilty of on the morning you went
away.’</p>

<p>“‘You would not be very angry, would you?’ asked
Nicholas.</p>

<p>“‘Wouldn’t I!’ said Miss La Creevy. ‘You had
better try; that’s all.’</p>

<p>“Nicholas, with becoming gallantry, immediately took
Miss La Creevy at her word, who uttered a faint scream
and slapped his face; but it was not a very hard slap, and
that’s the truth.</p>

<p>“‘I never saw such a rude creature!’ exclaimed Miss
La Creevy.</p>

<p>“‘You told me to try,’ said Nicholas.</p>

<p>“‘Well, but I was speaking ironically,’ rejoined Miss
La Creevy.</p>

<p>“‘Oh! that’s another thing,’ said Nicholas; ‘you
should have told me that, too.’”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“‘Look at me,’ said Nicholas, wishing to attract his
full attention. ‘There; don’t turn away. Do you remember
no woman, no kind woman, who hung over you
once, and kissed your lips, and called you her child?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“‘No,’ said the poor creature, shaking his head, ‘no,
never.’”</p>

<p>“‘It’s naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a
father, to see such a man as that, a kissing and taking
notice of my children,’ pursued Mr. Kenwigs. ‘It’s
naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a man, to know
that man. It will be naterally very gratifying to my feelings
as a husband, to make that man acquainted with this
ewent.’”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“‘No, no,’ cried Arthur, interrupting him, and rubbing
his hands in an ecstasy. ‘Wrong, wrong again. Mr.
Nickleby for once at fault: out, quite out! To a young
and beautiful girl; fresh, lovely, bewitching, and not
nineteen. Dark eyes, long eyelashes, ripe and ruddy lips
that to look at is to long to kiss, beautiful clustering hair
that one’s fingers itch to play with, such a waist as might
make a man clasp the air involuntarily thinking of twining
his arm about it, little feet that tread so lightly they
hardly seem to walk upon the ground,—to marry all this,
sir, this,—hey, hey!’”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Upon his knees Nicholas gave him this pledge, and
promised again that he should rest in the spot he had
pointed out. They embraced, and kissed each other on
the cheek. ‘Now,’ he murmured, ‘I am happy.’</p>

<p>“He fell into a light slumber, and waking smiled as
before; then, spoke of beautiful gardens, which he said
stretched out before him, and were filled with figures of
men, women, and many children, all with light upon
their faces; then, whispered that it was Eden,—and so
died.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>The following passages are from “David Copperfield:”</p>

<p>“As my mother stooped down on the threshold to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
me in her arms and kiss me, the gentleman said I was a
more highly privileged little fellow than a monarch,—or
something like that; for my later understanding comes, I
am sensible, to my aid here.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“I am glad to recollect that, when the carrier’s cart was
at the gate, and my mother stood there kissing me, a
grateful fondness for her and for the old place I had never
turned my back upon before, made me cry. I am glad
to know that my mother cried too, and that I felt her
heart beat against mine.</p>

<p>“I am glad to recollect that, when the carrier began to
move, my mother ran out at the gate, and called to him
to stop, that she might kiss me once more. I am glad to
dwell upon the earnestness and love with which she lifted
up her face to mine.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“When my mother came down to breakfast and was
going to make the tea, Miss Murdstone gave her a kind
of peck on the cheek, which was her nearest approach to
a kiss.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“‘And I’ll write to you, my dear. Though I ain’t no
scholar. And I’ll—I’ll—’ Peggotty fell to kissing the
keyhole, as she couldn’t kiss me.</p>

<p>“‘Thank you, dear Peggotty!’ said I. ‘Oh, thank
you! Thank you! Will you promise me one thing,
Peggotty? Will you write and tell Mr. Peggotty and
little Em’ly, and Mrs. Gummidge and Ham, that I am
not so bad as they might suppose, and that I sent ’em all
my love,—especially to little Em’ly? Will you, if you
please, Peggotty?’ The kind soul promised, and we
both of us kissed the keyhole with the greatest affection,—I
patted it with my hand, I recollect, as if it had been
her honest face,—and parted.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“Little Em’ly didn’t care a bit. She saw me well
enough, but, instead of turning round and calling after
me, ran away laughing. This obliged me to run after
her, and she ran so fast that we were very near the cottage
before I caught her.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, it’s you, is it?’ said little Em’ly.</p>

<p>“‘Why, you knew who it was, Em’ly,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘And didn’t <i>you</i> know who it was?’ said Em’ly. I
was going to kiss her, but she covered her cherry lips with
her hands, and said she wasn’t a baby now, and ran away,
laughing more than ever, into the house.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Peggotty was the best, the truest, the most faithful,
most devoted, and most self-denying friend and servant
in the world; who had ever loved me dearly, who had
ever loved my mother dearly; who had held my mother’s
dying head upon her arm, on whose face my mother had
imprinted her last grateful kiss. And my remembrance
of them both choking me, I broke down as I was trying
to say that her home was my home, and that all she had
was mine, and that I would have gone to her for shelter,
but for her humble station, which made me fear that I
might bring some trouble on her.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“And, having carried her point, she tapped the doctor’s
hand several times with her fan (which she kissed first),
and returned triumphantly to her former station.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Mrs. Markleham was so overcome by this generous
speech (which, I need not say, she had not at all expected
or led up to) that she could only tell the doctor it was
like himself, and go several times through that operation
of kissing the sticks of her fan, and then tapping his
hand with it.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>“She put her hand—its touch was like no other hand—upon
my arm for a moment; and I felt so befriended and
comforted that I could not help moving it to my lips
and gratefully kissing it.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Miss Murdstone had been looking for us. She found
us here; and presented her uncongenial cheek, the little
wrinkles in it filled with hair-powder, to Dora to be kissed.
Then she took Dora’s arm in hers, and marched us in to
breakfast as if it were a soldier’s funeral.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“I hardly knew what I did, I was burning all over to
that extraordinary extent; but I took Dora’s little hand
and kissed it, and she let me. I kissed Miss Mills’s hand,
and we all seemed, to my thinking, to go straight up to
the seventh heaven.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“‘But I haven’t got any strength at all,’ said Dora,
shaking her curls. ‘Have I, Jip?’ (the dog.) ‘Oh, do
kiss Jip and be agreeable!’</p>

<p>“It was impossible to resist kissing Jip, when she held
him up to me for that purpose, putting her own bright,
rosy little mouth into kissing form as she directed the
operation, which she insisted should be performed symmetrically,
on the centre of his nose. I did as she bade
me, rewarding myself afterwards for my obedience, and
she charmed me out of my graver character for I don’t
know how long.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“At length her eyes were lifted up to mine, and she
stood on tiptoe to give me, more thoughtfully than usual,
that precious little kiss—once, twice, three times—and
went out of the room.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“My pretty little Dora’s face would fall, and she would
make her mouth into a bud again, as if she would very
much prefer to shut mine with a kiss.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“And Mrs. Gummidge took his hand, and kissed it with
a homely pathos and affection, in a homely rapture of
devotion and gratitude that he well deserved.”</p>

Mutual Friend:”</p>

<p>“‘If I get by degrees to be a high-flyer at fashion,
then Mrs. Boffin will by degrees come for’arder. If Mrs.
Boffin should ever be less of a dab at fashion than she
is at the present time, then Mrs. Boffin’s carpet would go
back’arder. If we should both continny as we are, why
then <i>here</i> we are, and give us a kiss, old lady.’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Boffin, who, perpetually smiling, had approached
and drawn her plump arm through her lord’s, most willingly
complied. Fashion, in the form of her black velvet
hat and feathers, tried to prevent it, but got deservedly
crushed in the endeavor.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“‘This,’ said Mrs. Wilfer, presenting a cheek to be
kissed as sympathetic and responsive as the back of the
bowl of a spoon, ‘is quite an honor.’”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Arrived at Mr. Boffin’s door, she set him with his back
against it, tenderly took him by the ears as convenient
handles for her purpose, and kissed him until he knocked
muffled double knocks at the door with the back of his
head. That done, she once more reminded him of their
compact, and gaily parted from him.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“She girded herself with a white apron, and busily with
knots and pins contrived a bib to it, coming close and
tight under her chin, as if it had caught her round the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
neck to kiss her. Over this bib her dimples looked
delightful, and under it her pretty figure not less so.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Bella put her arms round his neck and tenderly kissed
him on the high-road, passionately telling him he was the
best of fathers and the best of friends, and that on her
wedding morning she would go down on her knees to him
and beg his pardon for having ever teased him or seemed
insensible to the worth of such a patient, sympathetic,
genial, fresh, young heart. At every one of her adjectives
she redoubled her kisses, and finally kissed his hat
off, and then laughed immoderately when the wind took
it and he ran after it.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“With a parting kiss of her fingers to it (the room), she
softly closed the door, and went with a light foot down
the great staircase, pausing and listening as she went, that
she might meet none of the household. No one chanced
to be about, and she got down to the hall in quiet. The
door of the late secretary’s room stood open. She peeped
in as she passed, and divined from the emptiness of his
table and the general appearance of things that he was
already gone. Softly opening the great hall-door and
softly closing it upon herself, she turned and kissed it on
the outside—insensible old combination of wood and iron
that it was—before she ran away from the house at a swift
pace.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“The good little fellow had become alarmingly limp,
and his senses seemed to be rapidly escaping, from the
knees upward. Bella sprinkled him with kisses instead of
milk, but gave him a little of that article to drink, and
he gradually revived under her caressing care.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Bella tucked her arm in his, with a merry, noiseless
laugh, and they went down to the kitchen on tiptoe, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
stopping on every separate stair to put the tip of her forefinger
on her rosy lips, and then lay it on his lips, according
to her favorite petting way of kissing pa.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“The purity with which in these words she expressed
something of her own love and her own suffering made
a deep impression on him for the passing time. He held
her, almost, as if she were sanctified to him by death, and
kissed her, once, almost as he might have kissed the
dead.”</p>

<p>Some of our best writers of fiction have successfully
tried their descriptive power upon the “torrent, tempest,
and whirlwind of passion” which maybe concentrated in
a burning kiss, but none of them surpass Victor Hugo in
graphic vigor. Take the following passages, for example,
from “The Hunchback of Notre Dame.” In the exciting
scene between Esmeralda, the gipsy, and Captain
Phœbus, the unfortunate girl proceeds:</p>

<p>“‘Look at me! look on her who came to seek you. My
soul, life, body, all are yours. Let us not marry, if it displeases
you,—and then, what am I? a wretched stroller,
while you, my Phœbus, are a gentleman. A pretty thing,
truly, for a dancing-girl to wed an officer! I was out of
my mind. No, Phœbus, I will be your toy, your plaything,
a slave to you. I am made for that; sullied,
scorned, dishonored, but loved! I will be the proudest
and gladdest of women. And when I shall be old,
Phœbus, when my days for loving you are over, you will,
won’t you, still allow me to serve you? Let others broider
your scarfs; I, the servant, may take care of them, and
your sword and your spurs. You will grant me this,
Phœbus? So, take me! we gipsies only are made for the
free air and to love.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>“She had flung her arms around the officer’s neck, supplicating
him with a smile shining through her tears. Her
delicate throat was scratched by the rough lace. The
intoxicated captain glued his burning lips on the rounded
Moorish shoulders. The young girl, kneeling, her eyes
looking upward, her head thrown back, quivered under
the kiss. All at once, above the stooping head of
Phœbus, she beheld another head, with a livid, convulsed
face, wearing the look of a damned soul; near it was a
hand armed with a dagger. It was the face and hand of
the priest; he had burst through the door, and was there.
Phœbus could not perceive him. The girl was frozen
stiff and mute by the fear-inspiring apparition,—like a
dove raising its head as the osprey stares over its nest with
its round, unwinking eyes. She could not even utter a
scream. She saw the poniard fall on Phœbus and rise
smoking.</p>

<p>“‘Malediction!’ groaned the captain, and he fell.</p>

<p>“She swooned.</p>

<p>“As her eyes closed, as feeling vanished from her, she
fancied she felt impressed on her lips a print of fire, a kiss
more burning than the executioner’s red-hot branding-iron.</p>

<p>“When she came to herself, she was surrounded by the
soldiers of the watch. They carried away the captain,
bathed in his blood; the priest had disappeared (the window
at the end of the room, looking on the river, was
wide open); a cloak was picked up which they supposed
belonged to the officer, and she heard it said around her,
‘She is a witch that has stabbed a captain.’”</p>

<p>The thrilling narrative proceeds with the imprisonment
of the poor girl, the false confession of murder and witchcraft
extorted by the terrible torture of rack and screw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
and pincer, the visit of the archdeacon, and his extraordinary
confession of maddening love. In the course of
his long and fervid and impetuous appeal for her favor,
he says:</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I had not foreseen the torture! Listen: I followed
thee into that chamber of agony; I looked upon
thy rough treatment by the torturer’s infamous hands. I
saw thy foot, which to kiss and die at I would give an
empire, I saw it crushed by the horrible irons which have
made of living limbs raw flesh and a pool of blood.
While I beheld this, I wielded under my gown a dagger,
with which I furrowed my breast. At the scream thou
gavest, I buried it in my flesh; look, it still bleeds.’”</p>

<p>“‘Oh, to love a woman, to be a priest, to be hated! to
love her with all the fury of one’s soul, to be willing to
give for the least of her smiles one’s blood, salvation,
immortality and eternity, this life and the other; to
regret not being a king, genius, emperor, archangel, that
a greater slave might be at her feet; to have her mingling
day and night in one’s thoughts and dreams; and to see
her enamored of a soldier’s livery, and only have to offer
her a priest’s coarse gown which is frightful to and detested
by her! To be present with rage and jealousy
while she lavishes on a despicable, empty-brained dog her
treasures of love and beauty! To see that body whose
sight makes you burn, that bosom so peerless, that satin
flesh redden under another’s kisses! Oh, to love her arms
and neck, to think of her blue veins visible through her
brown skin, almost to writhe whole nights through on the
pavement of one’s cell, and see all the caresses dreamed
of end with the torture!’”</p>

<p>The priest’s nightly dreams, we are told, were dreadful.
Writhing on his bed, “his delirious fancy represented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
Esmeralda in all the attitudes that could make blood boil
in one’s veins. He saw her as when he had stabbed
the captain, her white throat spotted with the blood of
Phœbus, when the archdeacon had impressed on her
shoulders that kiss which, though half dying then, she
had felt scorch her.” One night he became so inflamed
with his uncontrollable passion that he sought relief by a
visit to the gipsy’s cell, to which he had access. His entrance
awakened and bewildered her.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, the priest,’ said she, in a faint voice.</p>

<p>“Her misfortunes came back to her in a flash. She fell
back chilled. The next moment, she felt the priest’s
arms enclasp her. She would have screamed, but could
not.</p>

<p>“‘Away, monster, assassin, begone!’ gasped she, in a
voice low and tremulous from rage and fear.</p>

<p>“‘Mercy, mercy!’ muttered the priest, kissing her
shoulders.</p>

<p>“She caught his bald head, with both her hands entwined
in the rest of his hair, and forced it away as if his
kisses were bites.”</p>

<p>His utmost efforts to win her regard and sympathy
were ineffectual. He was baffled at every step in his
desperate advances, and repelled with immeasurable scorn
upon the repetition of his visits. He offered her the
alternative of the gibbet or escape and life; he humbled
himself before her to an incredible degree. In his passionate
entreaties, he says:</p>

<p>“‘Why, here am I who would kiss thy feet,—no, no,
not thy feet, thou wouldst not permit that,—but the very
ground under thy feet. I weep like a very child; I tear
from my breast, not words, but my heart and my vitals, to
tell thee that I love thee; all is in vain, all! And yet in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
thy spirit thou hast naught but tenderness and clemency,
thou art radiant with gentleness; thou art good, kind,
merciful as charming. Woe is me! thou hast not cruelty
save for me. Oh, what fatality!’”</p>

<p>At their last meeting he closes a strain of fervid supplication
the rejection of which settles the girl’s fate:</p>

<p>“‘I entreat thee by all that is holy, do not delay until
I am of stone like this scaffold thou choosest in my stead.
Think that I hold our two destinies in my palm, that I
am mad, that I can make yawn betwixt us a bottomless
pit, thou unfortunate! wherein my lost soul will pursue
thine through all eternity! One word of kindness! say
one word! nothing more than a word.’</p>

<p>“She parted her lips to answer him. He rushed and fell
on his knees before her to receive with adoration the
word—perhaps affectionate—which was about to leave
her lips.</p>

<p>“‘You are an assassin,’ was what she said.</p>

<p>“The priest threw his arms furiously around her, and
laughed a devil’s laugh. ‘Assassin—be it so!’ said he,
‘I will be thine. Thou wouldst not have me as a slave,—thou
shalt have me as master. I have a place to which
I’ll drag thee. Thou shalt go with me; I will make thee
go. Thou art to die, fair one, or be mine! be the priest’s,
the apostate’s, the assassin’s! To-night, dost hear? The
grave or my bed!’</p>

<p>“The girl fought in his arms while he covered her with
kisses.</p>

<p>“‘Do not bite me, monster!’ she shrieked. ‘Oh,
the hateful, infectious monk! leave me! I will tear out
that vile gray hair of yours.’</p>

<p>“He reddened, turned white, then released her, and
regarded her moodily. She thought herself victorious,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
and went on: ‘I tell you I am for Phœbus; that it is
Phœbus I love, because he is handsome. You, priest, are
old and ugly. Begone.”</p>

<p>The unalterable and final decision was made. It sent
Esmeralda to execution in the Place de Grève, and as the
archdeacon watched the tragedy,—the judicial murder of
an innocent creature for his own crime,—the revengeful
hunchback pushed him violently from the tower of Notre
Dame to meet a horrible death upon the pavement below.</p>

<p>Charles Reade deals with the kiss in the sturdy and
energetic manner which usually characterizes his writings.
In “Put Yourself in his Place,” the bursting of Ouseley
Reservoir gives him one of his best opportunities for the
display of vivid descriptive power and the production of
startling effects and situations. One of the most exciting
incidents attending the avalanche of water occasioned by
the rupture of the embankment was the rescue of Grace
Carden from the flood by her lover, Henry Little:</p>

<p>“He set his knee against the horizontal projection of the
window, and that freed his left hand; he suddenly seized
her arm with it, and, clutching it violently, ground his
teeth together, and, throwing himself backward with a
jerk, tore her out of the water by an effort almost superhuman.
Such was the force exerted by the torrent on
one side, and the desperate lover on the other, that not
her shoes only, but her stockings, though gartered, were
torn off her in that fierce struggle.</p>

<p>“He had her in his arms, and cried aloud, and sobbed
over her, and kissed her wet cheeks, her lank hair, and
her wet clothes, in a wild rapture. He went on kissing
her and sobbing over her so wildly and so long, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Coventry, who had at first exulted with him at her rescue,
began to rage with jealousy.</p>

<p>“‘Please remember she is my wife,’ he shrieked;
‘don’t take advantage of her condition, villain!’</p>

<p>“‘Your wife, you scoundrel! You stole her from me
once; now come and take her from me again. Why
didn’t you save her? She was near to you. You let her
die; she lives by me and for me, and I for her.’ With
this he kissed her again and held her to his bosom.
‘D’ye see that? liar! coward! villain!’</p>

<p>“Even across that tremendous body of rushing death,
from which neither was really safe, both rivals’ eyes
gleamed hate at each other.”</p>

<p>After a series of miraculous escapes, they descend from
the roof of the house whither they had finally sought protection
from the raging waters, and, staggering among
the <i>débris</i>, they finally reach rising ground, where they
discover a horse, upon which Henry seats the barefooted
Grace. Their conversation eventually takes this turn:</p>

<p>“‘Let us talk of ourselves,’ said Grace, lovingly. ‘My
darling, let no harsh thought mar the joy of this hour.
You have saved my life again. Well, then it is doubly
yours. Here, looking on that death we have just escaped,
I devote myself to you. You don’t know how I love
you, but you shall. I adore you.’</p>

<p>“‘I love you better still.’</p>

<p>“‘You do not; you can’t. It is the one thing I can
beat you at, and I will.’</p>

<p>“‘Try. When will you be mine?’</p>

<p>“‘I am yours. But if you mean when will I marry you,
why, whenever you please. We have suffered too cruelly
and loved too dearly for me to put you off a single day
for affectations and vanities. When you please, my own.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>“At this Henry kissed her little white feet with rapture,
and kept kissing them at intervals all the rest of the way;
and the horrors of the night ended to these two in unutterable
rapture, as they paced slowly along to Woodbine
Villa with hearts full of wonder, gratitude, and joy.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>These pleasant passages are from Reade’s “Very Hard
Cash:”</p>

<p>“The young man, ardent as herself, and not, in reality,
half so timorous, caught fire, and, seeing a white, eloquent
hand rather near him, caught it and pressed his
warm lips on it in mute adoration and gratitude.</p>

<p>“At this she was scared and offended. ‘Oh, keep that
for the queen!’ cried she, turning scarlet and tossing her
fair head into the air like a startled stag, and she drew
her hand away quickly and decidedly, though not roughly.
He stammered a lowly apology. In the very middle of it
she said, softly, ‘Good-by, Mr. Hardie,’ and swept with
a gracious little courtesy through the door-way, leaving
him spell-bound.</p>

<p>“And so the virginal instinct of self-defence carried her
off swiftly and cleverly. But none too soon; for, on entering
the house, that external composure her two mothers,
Mesdames Dodd and Nature, had taught her, fell from her
like a veil, and she fluttered up the stairs to her own room
with hot cheeks, and panted there like some wild thing
that has been grasped at and grazed. She felt young
Hardie’s lips upon the palm of her hand plainly; they
seemed to linger there still,—it was like light but live
velvet. This and the ardent look he had poured into
her eyes set the young creature quivering. Nobody had
looked at her so before, and no young gentleman had
imprinted living velvet on her hand. She was alarmed,
ashamed, and uneasy. What right had he to look at her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
like that? What shadow of a right to go and kiss her
hand? He could not pretend to think she had put it out
to be kissed; ladies put forth the back of the hand for
that, not the palm. The truth was, he was an impudent
fellow, and she hated him now, and herself too, for being
so simple as to let him talk to her. Mamma would not
have been so imprudent when she was a girl.</p>

<p>“She would not go down, for she felt there must be
something of this kind legibly branded on her face:
‘Oh! oh! just look at this young lady! She has been
letting a young gentleman kiss the palm of her hand, and
the feel has not gone off yet; you may see that by her
cheeks.’”</p>

<p>“<i>Jan. 14th.</i> A sorrowful day. He and I parted, after a
fortnight of the tenderest affection, and that mutual respect
without which neither of <i>us</i>, I think, could love
long. I had resolved to be very brave; but we were
alone, and his bright face looked so sad; the change in
it took me by surprise, and my resolution failed: I clung
to him. If gentlemen could interpret as we can, he would
never have left me. It is better as it is. He kissed my
tears away as fast as they came; it was the first time he
had ever kissed more than my hand,—so I shall have that
to think of, and his dear, promised letters; but it made
me cry more at the time, of course. Some day, when
we have been married years and years, I shall tell him not
to go and pay a lady for every tear, if he wants her to
leave off.” [Julia’s Diary.]</p>

<p>“‘Oh, how good you are! oh, how I love you!’</p>

<p>“And she flung a tender arm round his neck, like a
young goddess making love; and her sweet face came so
near his he had only to stoop a little, and their lips met in
a long, blissful kiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>“That kiss was an era in her life. Innocence itself, she
had put up her delicious lips to her lover in pure, though
earnest, affection; but the male fire with which his met
them made her blush as well as thrill, and she drew back
a little, abashed and half scared, and nestled on his
shoulder, hiding a face that grew redder and redder.”</p>

<p>Burton, in his “Anatomy of Melancholy,” notices
those irritating coquettes, Aretine’s Lucretia, and Philinna,
in Lucian, the former of whom boasted that she
had a suitor who loved her dearly, but the more eagerly
he wooed the more she seemed to neglect and to scorn
him, and what she commonly accorded to others—freedom
in social intercourse, even to the extent of osculation—she
refused to him; while the latter, in the
presence of her sweetheart Diphilus, kissed Lamprius,
his co-rival, in order to whet the jealousy of the favorite.
Our modern novelists give very little space to character
and conduct of this sort, but in the way of provokingly
cool indifference in the sterner sex to the charms and
fascinations of the fair, we find such instances as this,
which occurs in Mühlbach’s “Joseph the Second and his
Court,” in an interview between Kaunitz, the prime
minister, and La Foliazzi:</p>

<p>“‘<i>Vraiment</i>, you are very presuming to suppose that
I shall trouble myself to come in the carriage’ replied
Kaunitz, contemptuously. ‘It is enough that, the coach
being there, the world will suppose that I am there also.
A man of fashion must have the name of possessing a
mistress; but a statesman cannot waste his valuable time
on women. You are my mistress, <i>ostensibly</i>, and therefore
I give you a year’s salary of four thousand guilders.’</p>

<p>“‘You are an angel—a god!’ cried La Foliazzi, this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
time with genuine rapture. ‘You come upon one like
Jupiter, in a shower of gold.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, but I have no wish to fall into the embraces of
my Danaë. Now, hear my last words. If you ever dare
let it transpire that you are not really my mistress, I shall
punish you severely. I will not only stop your salary, but
I will cite you before the committee of morals, and you
shall be forced into a marriage with somebody.’</p>

<p>“The singer shuddered and drew back. ‘Let me go at
once into my boudoir. Is my breakfast ready?’</p>

<p>“‘No; your morning visits there begin to-morrow.
Now go home to Count Palffy, and do not forget our
contract.’</p>

<p>“‘I shall not forget it, prince,’ replied the signora,
smiling. ‘I await your coach this evening. You may
kiss me if you choose.’ She bent her head to his and
held out her delicate cheek, fresh as a rose.</p>

<p>“‘Simpleton,’ said he, slightly tapping her beautiful
mouth, ‘do you suppose that the great Kaunitz would
kiss any lips but those which, like the sensitive mimosa,
shrink from the touch of man? Go away. Count Palffy
will feel honored to reap the kisses I have left.’</p>

<p>“He gave her his hand, and looked after her, as with
light and graceful carriage she left the room.”</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, in his “Rob Roy,” tells us how
Frank Osbaldistone, in a moment of confusion and hesitancy,
failed to return the half-proffered embrace of
Diana Vernon, as she took leave of him on her way to
the seclusion of conventual life, and how his absence of
mind cost him many a bitter pang afterwards. It reminds
one of Michael Angelo, who, at sixty, was enamored of a
beautiful widow who died. The great painter and sculptor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
ever afterwards repented that he had not kissed her
forehead and cheeks, as well as her hand, at the hour of
parting:</p>

<p>“Miss Vernon had in the mean time taken out a small
case, and, leaning down from her horse towards me, she
said, in a tone in which an effort at her usual quaint lightness
of expression contended with a deeper and more
grave tone of sentiment, ‘You see, my dear coz, I was
born to be your better angel. Rashleigh has been compelled
to yield up his spoil, and had we reached this same
village of Aberfoil last night, as we purposed, I should
have found some Highland sylph to waft to you all these
representatives of commercial wealth. But there were
giants and dragons in the way; and errant knights and
damsels of modern times, bold though they be, must not,
as of yore, run into useless danger. Do not you do so
either, my dear coz.’</p>

<p>“‘Diana,’ said her companion, ‘let me once more
warn you that the evening waxes late, and we are still
distant from our home.’</p>

<p>“‘I am coming, sir, I am coming. Consider,’ she
added, with a sigh, ‘how lately I have been subjected to
control; besides, I have not yet given my cousin the
packet, and bid him farewell—forever. Yes, Frank,’
she said, ‘<i>forever</i>! There is a gulf between us,—a
gulf of absolute perdition; where we go you must not
follow; what we do you must not share in. Farewell,—be
happy!’</p>

<p>“In the attitude in which she bent from her horse, which
was a Highland pony, her face, not perhaps altogether
unwillingly, touched mine. She pressed my hand, while
the tear that trembled in her eye found its way to my
cheek instead of her own. It was a moment never to be
forgotten,—inexpressibly bitter, yet mixed with a sensation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
of pleasure so deeply soothing and affecting as at
once to unlock all the floodgates of the heart. It was <i>but</i>
a moment, however; for, instantly recovering from the
feeling to which she had involuntarily given way, she intimated
to her companion she was ready to attend him,
and, putting their horses to a brisk pace, they were soon
far distant from the place where I stood.</p>

<p>“Heaven knows, it was not apathy which loaded my
frame and my tongue so much that I could neither return
Miss Vernon’s half embrace, nor even answer her
farewell. The word, though it rose to my tongue, seemed
to choke in my throat, like the fatal <i>guilty</i>, which the
delinquent who makes it his plea knows must be followed
by the doom of death. The surprise, the sorrow,
almost stupefied me. I remained motionless, with the
packet in my hand, gazing after them, as if endeavoring
to count the sparkles which flew from the horses’ hoofs. I
continued to look after even these had ceased to be visible,
and to listen for their footsteps long after the last
distant trampling had died in my ears. At length, tears
rushed to my eyes, glazed as they were by the exertion of
straining after what was no longer to be seen. I wiped
them mechanically and almost without being aware that
they were flowing, but they came thicker and thicker;
I felt the tightening of the throat and breast,—the <i>hysterica
passio</i> of poor Lear,—and, sitting down by the
wayside, I shed a flood of the first and most bitter tears
which had flowed from my eyes since childhood.”</p>

<p>The admirers of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “Scarlet Letter”
will not forget the caprices of little Pearl.</p>

<p>“‘Dost thou know thy mother now, child?’ asked
Hester, reproachfully, but with a subdued tone. ‘Wilt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
thou come across the brook and own thy mother, now that
she has her shame upon her, now that she is sad?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, now I will!’ answered the child, bounding
across the brook and clasping Hester in her arms. ‘Now
thou art my mother indeed! and I am thy little Pearl!’</p>

<p>“In a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her,
she drew down her mother’s head and kissed her brow
and both her cheeks. But then, by a kind of necessity
that always impelled this child to alloy whatever comfort
she might chance to give with a throb of anguish, Pearl
put up her mouth and kissed the scarlet letter too!</p>

<p>“‘That was not kind,’ said Hester. ‘When thou hast
shown me a little love, thou mockest me!’”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive
with every petted child towards a dangerous rival, or
from whatever caprice of her freakish nature, Pearl would
show no favor to the clergyman. It was only by an exertion
of force that her mother brought her up to him,
hanging back, and manifesting her reluctance by odd
grimaces, of which, ever since her babyhood, she had
possessed a singular variety, and could transform her
mobile physiognomy into a series of different aspects, with
a new mischief in them, each and all. The minister,
painfully embarrassed, but hoping that a kiss might prove
a talisman to admit him into the child’s kindlier regards,
bent forward and impressed one on her brow. Hereupon
Pearl broke away from her mother, and, running to the
brook, stooped over it and bathed her forehead until the
unwelcome kiss was quite washed off and diffused through
a long lapse of the gliding water.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Pearl either saw and responded to her mother’s feelings,
or herself felt the remoteness and intangibility that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
had fallen around the minister. While the procession
passed, the child was uneasy, fluttering up and down like
a bird on the point of taking flight. When the whole
had gone by, she looked up into Hester’s face.</p>

<p>“‘Mother,’ said she, ‘was that the same minister that
kissed me by the brook?’</p>

<p>“‘Hold thy peace, dear little Pearl,’ whispered her
mother. ‘We must not always talk in the market-place
of what happens to us in the forest.’</p>

<p>“‘I could not be sure that it was he, so strange he
looked,’ continued the child: ‘else I would have run to
him and bid him kiss me now before all the people, even
as he did yonder among the dark old trees. What would
the minister have said, mother? Would he have clapped
his hand over his heart, and scowled on me, and bid me
begone?’</p>

<p>“‘What should he say, Pearl,’ answered Hester, ‘save
that it was no time to kiss, and that kisses are not to be
given in the market-place? Well for thee, foolish child,
that thou didst not speak to him.’”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“The minister withdrew his dying eyes from the old
man and fixed them on the woman and the child.</p>

<p>“‘My little Pearl,’ said he, feebly,—and there was a
sweet and gentle smile over his face, as of a spirit sinking
into deep repose; nay, now that the burden was removed
it seemed almost as if he would be sportive with
the child,—‘dear little Pearl, wilt thou kiss me now?
Thou wouldst not yonder in the forest; but now thou
wilt?’</p>

<p>“Pearl kissed his lips. A spell was broken. The great
scene of grief in which the wild infant bore a part had
developed all her sympathies, and as her tears fell upon
her father’s cheek they were the pledge that she would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
grow up amid human joy and sorrow, nor forever do
battle with the world, but be a woman in it. Towards
her mother, too, Pearl’s errand as a messenger of anguish
was all fulfilled.</p>

<p>“‘Hester,’ said the clergyman, ‘farewell!’</p>

<p>“‘Shall we not meet again?’ whispered she, bending
her face down close to his. ‘Shall we not spend our
immortal life together? Surely, surely, we have ransomed
one another, with all this woe! Thou lookest far
into eternity with those bright, dying eyes!’”</p>

<p class="noindent">we can find no touches more exquisite than these from
Rev. Charles Kingsley’s “Yeast;”</p>

<p>“They parted with a long, lingering pressure of the
hand, which haunted her young palm all night in dreams.
Argemone got into the carriage, Lancelot jumped into
the dog-cart, took the reins and relieved his heart by galloping
Sandy up the hill and frightening the returning
coachman down one bank and his led horses up the other.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Vogue la Galère</i>, Lancelot! I hope you have made
good use of your time?’</p>

<p>“But Lancelot spoke no word all the way home, and
wandered till dawn in the woods around his cottage,
kissing the hand which Argemone’s hand had pressed.”
[Ch. vii.]</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“Entranced in wonder and pleasure, Argemone let her
eyes wander over the drawing. And her feelings for Lancelot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
amounted almost to worship, as she apprehended the
harmonious unity of the manifold conception, the rugged
boldness of the groups in front, the soft grandeur of the
figure which was the lodestar of all their emotions, the
virginal purity of the whole. And when she fancied that
she traced in those bland aquiline lineaments, and in the
crisp ringlets which floated like a cloud down to the knees
of the figure, some traces of her own likeness, a dream of
a new destiny flitted before her, she blushed to her very
neck; and as she bent her face over the drawing and
gazed, her whole soul seemed to rise into her eyes, and a
single tear dropped upon the paper. She laid her hand
over it and then turned hastily away.</p>

<p>“‘You do not like it? I have been too bold,’ said
Lancelot, fearfully.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, no, no! It is so beautiful, so full of deep wisdom!
But—but—You may leave it.’</p>

<p>“Lancelot slipped silently out of the room, he hardly
knew why; and when he was gone, Argemone caught up
the drawing, pressed it to her bosom, covered it with
kisses, and hid it, as too precious for any eyes but her own,
in the furthest corner of her secrétaire.</p>

<p>“And yet she fancied that she was not in love!”
[Ch. x.]</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“‘Argemone! speak; tell me, if you will, to go forever;
but tell me first the truth. You love me!’</p>

<p>“A strong shudder ran through her frame, the ice of artificial
years cracked, and the clear stream of her woman’s
nature welled up to the light, as pure as when she first lay
on her mother’s bosom. She lifted up her eyes, and with
one long look of passionate tenderness she faltered out,—</p>

<p>“‘I love you!’</p>

<p>“He did not stir, but watched her with clasped hands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
like one who in dreams finds himself in some fairy palace
and fears that a movement may break the spell.</p>

<p>“‘Now, go,’ she said; ‘go and let me collect my
thoughts. All this has been too much for me. Do not
look sad; you may come again to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“She smiled, and held out her hand. He caught it, covered
it with kisses, and pressed it to his heart. She half
drew it back, frightened. The sensation was new to her.
Again the delicious feeling of being utterly in his power
came over her, and she left her hand upon his heart, and
blushed as she felt its passionate throbbings.</p>

<p>“He turned to go,—not as before. She followed with
greedy eyes her new-found treasure; and as the door
closed behind him she felt as if Lancelot was the whole
world and there was nothing beside him, and wondered
how a moment had made him all in all to her; and then
she sunk upon her knees and folded her hands upon her
bosom, and her prayers for him were like the prayers of a
little child.”</p>

<p>The colors of these pictures are painfully heightened
by contrast with the gloom of the valley of the shadow
of death, through which Argemone was soon afterwards
summoned to pass.</p>

<p>The treatment of this theme—a theme which is unfailingly
attractive to both sexes, to youth with its
yearnings and promptings, to age with its retrospects and
reminiscences—deserves further selections.</p>

<p>In “The Broken Pitcher” of Zchokke, the delightful
German story-teller, is a pleasing scene which shows how
the current of love ran smoothly at last, and how the ambitious
plans of a match-making parent were defeated:</p>

<p>“As they entered the parsonage she looked at him affectionately,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
and, seeing his bright eyes moistened with tears,
she whispered in his ear, ‘<i>Dear Colin</i>.’ Then he bent
down and kissed her hand. At this, the door of a room
was opened, and the venerable form of Father Jerome
stood before them. Just then the young folks seemed
seized with giddiness, for they held fast to each other for
support. I do not know whether it was the effect of the
hand-kissing, or of their veneration for the good Father.</p>

<p>“Mariette handed him the myrtle-wreath. He placed
it around her brow, and said, ‘<i>Children, Love one another!</i>’
beseeching Mariette in the most tender and
touching manner to love Colin. It seems that the old
gentleman had either misunderstood the bridegroom’s
name on account of his deafness, or had forgotten it in
consequence of his failing memory, and thought of course
that Colin must be the bridegroom.</p>

<p>“Mariette’s heart was softened by the exhortation of
the pious priest, and with tears and sighs she said, ‘I love
him already, and have long loved him, but he always
hated me.’</p>

<p>“‘I hated you, Mariette?’ exclaimed Colin; ‘ever
since you came to La Napoule my soul has lived in you
alone. Oh, Mariette! how could I ever entertain the hope
that you had any regard for me?’</p>

<p>“‘Why did you avoid me, Colin, and prefer the society
of my companions to mine?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Mariette! I was tossed about on a sea of fear and
trembling, of anxiety and love, whenever I saw you. I
had not the courage to approach you, and if I was not
near you I was most miserable.’ As they talked so
earnestly, the good father thought they were quarrelling:
so he put his arms around them, brought them gently
together, and said, in an imploring tone, ‘My dear, dear
children, love one another!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>“Then sank Mariette upon Colin’s breast; Colin threw
his arms around her, and both faces beamed with unspeakable
delight. They forgot the priest, forgot everything.
Colin’s lips were pressed to Mariette’s sweet
mouth. It was only a kiss, yet a kiss of loveliest forgetfulness.
Both were completely wrapped up in each other.
Both had so entirely lost their recollection that, without
knowing what they did, they involuntarily followed the
delighted Father Jerome into the church, and before the
altar.”</p>

<p>In “Fair Harvard” is another narrow escape of two
loving hearts from separation:</p>

<p>“The sight of Miss Campbell’s grief recalled Wentworth
to his senses.</p>

<p>“‘Forgive me!’ he cried, passionately. ‘I knew not
what I said. My love for you has made me beside myself.
It was my wounded vanity that spoke. It is my
misfortune, not your fault, that you did not love me.
Tell me that you forgive me. Though I love you more
than all the world besides, I will never see you again.’</p>

<p>“‘Never again, Wentworth?’ The girl raised her
head, a smile broke through her tears, her lips quivered
with tenderness.</p>

<p>“‘Darling, I will never leave you!’ cried her happy
lover, and caught her half reluctant in his arms, and set
love’s sweet seal upon his vow.</p>

<p>“A diviner beauty shone from the girl’s fair face; a
tenderer light beamed from her sunny eyes.</p>

<p>“‘Dearest!’ she whispered,—the magic of her voice
unlocked the gates of sense, filled the air with visions of
beauty, and called over the laughing waves the music
of heavenly choirs,—‘Dearest, tell me again that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
love me.’ She sank upon her lover’s breast transfigured.</p>

<p>“‘Dearest!’ she again whispered, ‘will you love me
always as now?’</p>

<p>“‘Always, darling, always! Would that now were forever?
Nay, love, I would give my hope of immortal life
to win this moment of delight!’</p>

<p>“‘Hush! hush!’ the girl clung closer to her lover.</p>

<p>“‘Not such love, but that you will always be noble and
true, and—and will love no one else so well.’”</p>

<p>In Charlotte Brontë’s masterpiece, Jane Eyre returns
to Thornfield after the long separation enforced by a
painful adventure. She learns, upon revisiting the old
familiar scenes, of the destruction of Thornfield Hall by
fire, and of the violent death of the maniac wife. She finds
that the lonely and sightless Rochester is an occupant of
Ferndean manor-house, and she glides quietly into his
parlor unannounced:</p>

<p>“‘This is you, Mary, is it not?’</p>

<p>“‘Mary is in the kitchen,’ I answered.</p>

<p>“He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but, not seeing
where I stood, he did not touch me. ‘Who is this?
who is this?’ he demanded, trying, as it seemed, to <i>see</i>
with those sightless eyes,—unavailing and distressing
attempt! ‘Answer me,—speak again!’ he ordered, imperiously
and aloud.</p>

<p>“‘Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilled half
of what was in the glass,’ I said.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Who</i> is it? <i>What</i> is it? Who speaks?’</p>

<p>“‘Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here;
I came only this evening,’ I answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>“‘Great God! what delusion has come over me? What
sweet madness has seized me?’</p>

<p>“‘No delusion, no madness; your mind, sir, is too
strong for delusion, your health too sound for frenzy.’</p>

<p>“‘And where is this speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh!
I <i>cannot</i> see, but I must feel, or my heart will stop, and
my brain burst. Whatever—whoever you are—be perceptible
to the touch, or I cannot live.’</p>

<p>“He groped; I arrested his wandering hand and prisoned
it in both mine.</p>

<p>“‘Her very fingers!’ he cried; ‘her small slight
fingers! If so, there must be more of her.’</p>

<p>“The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm
was seized, my shoulder, neck, waist—I was entwined and
gathered to him.</p>

<p>“‘Is it Jane? <i>What</i> is it? This is her shape,—this
is her size——’</p>

<p>“‘And this is her voice,’ I added. ‘She is all here;
her heart, too. God bless you, sir! I am glad to be so
near you again.’</p>

<p>“‘Jane Eyre! Jane Eyre!’ was all he said.</p>

<p>“‘My dear master,’ I answered, ‘I am Jane Eyre; I
have found you out. I am come back to you.’</p>

<p>“‘In truth? In the flesh? My living Jane?’</p>

<p>“‘You touch me, sir,—you hold me, and fast enough;
I am not cold like a corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?’</p>

<p>“‘My living darling! These are certainly her limbs,
and these her features; but I cannot be so blessed after
all my misery. It is a dream; such dreams as I have had
at night, when I clasped her once more to my heart, as I
do now; and kissed her as thus—and felt that she loved
me, and trusted she would not leave me.’</p>

<p>“‘Which I never will, sir, from this day.’</p>

<p>“‘Never will, says the vision! But I always woke and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
found it an empty mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned,—my
life dark, lonely, hopeless,—my soul athirst
and forbidden to drink,—my heart famished and never to
be fed. Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now,
you will fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you;
but kiss me before you go,—embrace me, Jane.’</p>

<p>“‘There, sir; and there!’</p>

<p>“I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless
eyes,—I swept his hair from his brow, and kissed that,
too. He suddenly seemed to rouse himself; the conviction
of the reality of all this seized him.</p>

<p>“‘It is you,—is it, Jane? You are come back to me,
then?’</p>

<p>“‘I am.’”</p>

<p>In “Lothair,” Mr. Disraeli does not leave his hero and
heroine until they start to “walk the long path in peace
together:”</p>

<p>“‘Where can they have all gone?’ said Lady Corisande,
looking round. ‘We must find them.’</p>

<p>“‘And leave this garden?’ said Lothair. ‘And I
without a flower, the only one without a flower? I am
afraid that is significant of my lot.’</p>

<p>“‘You shall choose a rose,’ said Lady Corisande.</p>

<p>“‘Nay; the charm is, that it should be your choice.’</p>

<p>“But choosing the rose lost more time, and, when
Corisande and Lothair reached the arches of golden yew,
there were no friends in sight.</p>

<p>“‘I think I hear sounds this way,’ said Lothair, and he
led his companion farther from home.</p>

<p>“‘I see no one,’ said Corisande, distressed, and when
they had advanced a little way.</p>

<p>“‘We are sure to find them in good time,’ said Lothair.
‘Besides, I wanted to speak to you about the garden at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
Muriel. I wanted to induce you to go there and help me
to make it. Yes,’ he added, after some hesitation, ‘on
this spot—I believe on this very spot—I asked the permission
of your mother two years ago to express to you my
love. She thought me a boy, and she treated me as a
boy. She said I knew nothing of the world, and both
our characters were unformed. I know the world now.
I have committed many mistakes, doubtless many follies;
have formed many opinions, and have changed many
opinions; but to one I have been constant, in one I am
unchanged, and that is my adoring love to you.’</p>

<p>“She turned pale, she stopped, then, gently taking his
arm, she hid her face in his breast.</p>

<p>“He soothed and sustained her agitated frame, and
sealed with an embrace her speechless form. Then, with
soft thoughts and softer words, clinging to him, he induced
her to resume their stroll, which both of them now wished
might assuredly be undisturbed. They had arrived at the
limit of the pleasure-grounds, and they wandered into
the park and its most sequestered parts. All this time
Lothair spoke much, and gave her the history of his life
since he first visited her home. Lady Corisande said
little, but, when she was more composed, she told him
that from the first her heart had been his, but everything
seemed to go against her hopes. Perhaps at last, to please
her parents, she would have married the Duke of Brecon,
had not Lothair returned; and what he had said to her
that morning at Crecy House had decided her resolution,
whatever might be her lot, to unite it to no one else but
him. But then came the adventure of the crucifix, and
she thought all was over for her, and she quitted town in
despair.”</p>

<p>But not always is the ending thus smoothed and harmonized,
mutual consecration thus rewarded, mutual trust<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
thus irradiated. Sometimes for the diadem of love is
substituted a crown of thorns, and for the aureole of faith
and hope the gloom and shadow of despair; sometimes
the steps which together had been peaceful and happy
are made to diverge into the pathways which lead through
dreary interpretation of duty, or fateful compulsion, to
that abiding sorrow which only finds rest in the grave.</p>

<p>Here is a sad picture from Anne M. Crane’s “Opportunity:”</p>

<p>“Gazing upon this agony of despair, an uncontrollable
impulse swept over the woman, seized upon her, to stretch
out her hands and cry to him,—</p>

<p>“‘Douglas, your only mistake has been in not seeing
that my heart is not dead, but sleeping; that you could
still teach me to love you; that we might yet be supremely
happy.’</p>

<p>“How mighty was the temptation would never be known
except to Harvey Berney and her God; but its power
culminated and passed before he found strength to speak
again. No, he had voluntarily pledged his word and
promise to another, and that pledge must be redeemed;
he must bear his hard fate as best he might. She thought
of the utter desolation which would descend on another
woman’s life, were she now to take from it what it had
rightfully won. For herself it was the surrender of a
future bliss, of a joy which would have come forth in the
fulness of time; to that other it would be annihilation
of happiness now and forever. Broken heart on the
woman’s side, broken faith on the man’s,—that price
must not be paid for any earthly good. For his own sake
she did not dare to grant his heart’s desire; ah, yes! and
the desire of her own. Better misery, failure, and disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
than that they should willingly sink to false
degeneracy.</p>

<p>“Swiftly but surely she had counted the cost, when,
after a moment, the man’s voice again broke the stillness:</p>

<p>“‘From that night I should have gone down to destruction
if Rose had not put out her hand to me. I clung to
it then, and my one chance for heaven and earth is to
cling to it until I die. You women, who lead such quiet,
sheltered lives, can never know or comprehend a man’s
terrible necessity for some semblance of hope and happiness.
Rose takes me just as I am, and I pray, for her
sake, that she may save me.’</p>

<p>“‘And I pray the same prayer for your sake, and I know
that it will be answered,’ cried Harvey’s quivering voice,
as the hot tears sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p>“The man gazed straight into them.</p>

<p>“I shall remember that,’ he said, in a different tone
from that which he had been using. ‘I shall always remember
that, though we part now perhaps forever. My
love is a love for life and death, for time and eternity, yet
for this world we die to each other from to-night. But,
Harvey,’ he said, coming close to her and speaking with
a horrible breathlessness, as though soul and body were
being torn asunder, ‘dying men gain their own rights
and privileges.’ He took that noble, tender face within
his hands, and raised it for one last long look. But he
could not, he would not go, taking with him only that.
Suddenly the strong arms were about her, holding her,
straining her to that madly-throbbing heart, while upon
lips and cheeks and brow fell long burning kisses, each
one of which seemed to claim and seal her as his own.
Suddenly again she felt herself released, and after a moment
knew that he was gone. Then she sank down before
the fire, heart-sick and desolate, knowing that she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
surrendered forever the man who loved her and whom she
might have loved.”</p>

<p>But both remembered the words of Robert Browning,
“This life of mine must be lived out, and a grave
thoroughly earned,” and both bravely and patiently endured
unto the end. Far different was the tragic fate of
the “Bride of Lammermoor:”</p>

<p>“Lucy covered her face with her hands, and the tears, in
spite of her, forced their way between her fingers. ‘Forgive
me,’ said Ravenswood, taking her right hand, which,
after slight resistance, she yielded to him, still continuing
to shade her face with the left; ‘I am too rude—too
rough—too intractable to deal with any being so soft and
gentle as you are. Forget that so stern a vision has
crossed your path of life, and let me pursue mine, sure
that I can meet with no worse misfortune after the moment
it divides me from your side.’</p>

<p>“Lucy wept on, but her tears were less bitter. Each
attempt which the master made to explain his purpose of
departure only proved a new evidence of his desire to
stay; until, at length, instead of bidding her farewell, he
gave his faith to her forever and received her troth in return.
The whole passed so suddenly, and arose so much
out of the immediate impulse of the moment, that ere the
master of Ravenswood could reflect upon the consequences
of the step which he had taken, their lips as well
as their hands had pledged the sincerity of their affection.”</p>

<p>Every reader of this sorrowful story will remember how
Lucy was forced by her mother into an agreement to
marry a detested wretch on account of his wealth; how
Ravenswood confronted the family and poured out the
terrors of his wrath and indignation; how he closed his
scathing invectives by turning to Lucy with the words,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
“And to you, madam, I have nothing further to say, except
to pray to God that you may not become a world’s
wonder for this act of wilful and deliberate perjury;”
how Lucy, in a paroxysm of insanity, attempted to murder
Bucklaw in the bridal chamber; and how, soon after,
death closed for her the tragic scenes of earth.</p>

<p>How a loving kiss enfeebled and finally paralyzed the
arm of a murderess is told by Bulwer-Lytton in his “Lucretia:”</p>

<p>“Late in the evening, before she retired to rest, Helen
knocked gently at her aunt’s door. A voice quick and
startled bade her enter. She came in with her sweet,
caressing look, and took Lucretia’s hand, which struggled
from the clasp. Bending over that haggard brow, she
said, simply, yet to Lucretia’s ear the voice seemed that
of command, ‘Let me kiss you this night!’ and her
lips pressed that brow. The murderess shuddered, and
closed her eyes; when she opened them, the angel visitor
was gone.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>What followed was the theme of a conference with a
fellow-conspirator, from which we extract the following
dialogue:</p>

<p>“Shutting the door with care, and turning the key,
Gabriel said, with low, suppressed passion,—</p>

<p>“‘Well, your mind seems wandering. Speak!’</p>

<p>“‘It is strange,’ said Lucretia, in hollow tones. ‘Can
Nature turn accomplice, and befriend us here?’</p>

<p>“‘Nature! did you not last night administer the——’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ interrupted Lucretia. ‘No; she came into the
room; she kissed me here, on the brow that even then
was meditating murder. The kiss burned; it burns still;—it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
eats, into the brain like remorse. But I did not yield;
I read again her false father’s protestation of love; I read
again the letter announcing the discovery of my son, and
remorse lay still; I went forth as before; I stole into her
chamber; I had the fatal crystal in my hand——’</p>

<p>“‘Well! well!’</p>

<p>“‘And suddenly there came the fearful howl of a dog:
and the dog’s fierce eyes glared on me; I paused, I trembled;
Helen started, woke, called aloud; I turned and
fled. The poison was not given.’”</p>

<p>And afterwards she said,—</p>

<p>“‘That kiss still burns; I will stir in this no more.’”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 6.25em;">

<p>When it comes to the “last scene of all that ends this
strange eventful history,” few can equal in power and
pathos the popular writer, Samuel Warren, as witness one
or two passages in the “Diary of a Physician.”</p>

<p>In “The Wife,” which is a record of incredible atrocities
on the part of a brutal husband, and of patient endurance
and endless forgiveness on the part of the wife,
we come to the closing scene:</p>

<p>“‘Well, George, we must part!’ said she, closing her
eyes and breathing softly, but fast. Her husband sobbed
like a child, with his face buried in his handkerchief.
‘Do you forgive me?’ he murmured, half choked with
emotion.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, dear—dear—dearest husband! God knows how
I do from my heart! I forgive all the little you have ever
grieved me about.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Jane—Jane—Jane!’ groaned the man, suddenly
stooping over the bed and kissing her lips in an apparent
ecstasy. He fell down on his knees and cried bitterly.</p>

<p>“‘Rise, George, rise,’ said his wife, faintly. He obeyed
her, and she again clasped his hand in hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>“‘George, are you there—are you?’ she inquired, in a
voice fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>“‘Here I am, love!—oh, look on me! look on me!’
he sobbed, gazing steadily on her features. ‘Say once
more that you forgive me! Let me hear your dear,
blessed voice again—or—or—’</p>

<p>“‘I do! kiss me—kiss me,’ she murmured, almost inaudibly;
and her unworthy, her guilty husband kissed
away the last expiring breath of one of the loveliest and
most injured women whose hearts have been broken by a
husband’s brutality.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>In that singular instance of premonstration, “The
Broken Heart,” we follow with eager interest to its natural
and most sorrowful conclusion the sorrowful revelation
so unexpectedly made to a gentle and pensive girl, in the
midst of her song at a brilliant party, of the death of her
affianced on the battle-field. There was nothing left for
her then but to welcome the peace of the grave,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Like a lily drooping,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bow her head and die.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the family’s being summoned into the chamber of
death,—</p>

<p>“Her sister Jane was the first that entered, her eyes
swollen with weeping, and seemingly half suffocated with
the effort to conceal her emotions.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, my darling, precious,—my own sister Annie!’
she sobbed, and knelt down at the bedside, flinging her
arms round her sister’s neck, kissing the gentle sufferer’s
cheeks and mouth.</p>

<p>“‘Annie! love! darling!—don’t you know me?’ she
groaned, kissing her forehead repeatedly. Could I help
weeping? All who had entered were standing around
the bed, sobbing, and in tears. I kept my fingers at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
wrist of the dying sufferer, but could not feel whether or
not the pulse beat, which, however, I attributed to my
own agitation.</p>

<p>“‘Speak—speak—my darling Annie! speak to me; I
am your poor sister Jane!’ sobbed the agonized girl,
continuing fondly kissing her sister’s cold lips and forehead.
She suddenly started, exclaimed, ‘Oh, God!
<i>she’s dead!</i>’ and sank instantly senseless on the floor.
Alas, alas! it was too true; my sweet and broken-hearted
patient was no more.”</p>

<p>The author of “Guy Livingstone” gives us these noteworthy
passages:</p>

<p>“He bent down his lofty head, and instantly their lips
met, and were set together fast.</p>

<p>“A kiss! Tibullus, Secundus, Moore, and a thousand
other poets and poetasters have rhymed on the word for
centuries, decking it with the choicest and quaintest conceits.
But, remember, it was with a kiss that the greatest
of all criminals sealed the unpardonable sin; it was a kiss
which brought on Francesca punishment so unutterably
piteous that he swooned at the sight who endured to look
on all the other horrors of nine-circled hell.”</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>“He laid the light burden, that scarcely weighed upon
his arm, down on the pillows, very softly and gently,
smoothing them mechanically with his hand. Then he
stooped and pressed one kiss more on the pale lips: they
never felt it, though the passion of that lengthened caress
might almost have waked the dead. And so those two
parted, to meet again upon earth never more.</p>

<p>“The next time woman’s lips touched Guy Livingstone’s,
they were his mother’s, and he had been a corpse
an hour.”</p>

</div>

<h3>FATHER TOM AND THE POPE.</h3>

<p>Every one who knows anything of the humorous literature
of the century has laughed a hundred times over that
wonderful story of “Father Tom and the Pope; or, A
Night at the Vatican,” which has been attributed to so
many of the leading Irish humorists, and is enough of
itself to have made the reputation of the best of them.
From its first appearance, in “Blackwood,” Catholics and
Protestants alike have enjoyed its marvellous and abounding
fun, and it is one of the few things written in our
time which people do not refuse to read to-day because of
having read them yesterday and the day before.</p>

<p>Those who know the story will remember that the reverend
Father being “in Room, ov coorse the Pope axed
him to take pot-look wid him,” and they proceeded
together to “invistigate the composition of distilled
liquors.” As sociability grew warm between them, Father
Tom volunteered to astonish his Holiness with a new
“preparation ov chymicals,” after the manner of the
“ould counthry.” To make this “miraculous mixthir”
exactly what it ought to be, his reverence insisted that “a
faymale hand was ondispinsably necessary to produce the
adaptation ov the particles,” and the butler of the Vatican
had accordingly brought up “Miss Eliza,” one of
the fairest maids of the household, that she might stir the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
milk in the skillet with the little finger of her right hand.
Miss Eliza is described as “stepping like a three-year-old,
and blushing like the brake of day,” and the Pope
had very early to rebuke his reverence with some sternness
for his “deludhering talk to the young woman.”
Nothing daunted, however, the gallant Father managed
somehow to upset the candle and put the “windy-curtains”
in peril of fire, and while the rest of the company
were engaged in “getting things put to rights,” the incident,
or accident, occurred which can only be told in the
words of the story.</p>

<p>“And now,” says Mickey Hefferman, the story-teller,
“I have to tell you ov a raally onpleasant occurrence.
If it was a Prodesan that was in it, I’d say that while the
Pope’s back was turned, Father Tom made free wid the
two lips ov Miss Eliza; but, upon my conscience, I believe
it was a mere mistake that his Holiness fell into, on
account ov his being an ould man and not having aither
his eyesight or his hearing very parfect. At any rate it
can’t be denied but that he had a sthrong imprission that
sich was the case; for he wheeled about as quick as thought
jist as his riv’rence was sitting down, and charged him
wid the offince plain and plump. ‘Is it kissing my housekeeper
before my face you are, you villain?’ says he.
‘Go down out o’ this,’ says he to Miss Eliza, ‘and do
you be packing off wid you,’ he says to Father Tom, ‘for
it’s not safe, so it isn’t, to have the likes ov you in a
house where there’s timptation in your way.’</p>

<p>“‘Is it me?’ says his riv’rence; ‘why, what would
your Holiness be at, at all? Sure I wasn’t doing no sich
thing.’</p>

<p>“‘Would you have me doubt the evidence ov my
sinses?’ says the Pope; ‘would you have me doubt the
testimony ov my eyes and ears?’ says he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>“‘Indeed I would so,’ says his riv’rence, ‘if they pretind
to have informed your Holiness ov any sich foolishness.’</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ says the Pope, ‘I seen you afther kissing
Eliza as plain as I see the nose on your face; I heard the
shmack you gave her as plain as ever I heard thundher.’</p>

<p>“‘And how do you know whether you see the nose on
my face or not?’ says his riv’rence; ‘and how do you
know whether wrhat you thought was thundher was thundher
at all? Them operations ov the sinses,’ says he,
‘comprises only particular corporayal emotions, connected
wid sartin confused perciptions called sinsations, and
isn’t to be depended upon at all. If we were to follow
them blind guides, we might jist as well turn heretics at
ons’t. ’Pon my secret word, your Holiness, it’s naither
charitable nor orthodox ov you to set up the testimony ov
your eyes and ears agin the characther of a clargyman.
And now see how aisy it is to explain all them phwenomena
that perplexed you. I ris and went over beside
the young woman because the skillet was boiling over, to
help her to save the dhrop ov liquor that was in it; and as
for the noise you heard, my dear man, it was naither more
nor less nor myself dhrawing the cork out ov this blessed
bottle.’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t offer to thrape that upon me!’ says the Pope;
‘here’s the cork in the bottle still, as tight as a wedge.’</p>

<p>“‘I beg your pardon,’ says his riv’rence; ’that’s not
the cork at all,’ says he. ‘I dhrew the cork a good two
minits ago, and it’s very purtily spitted on the end ov this
blessed cork-shcrew at this prisint moment; howandiver
you can’t see it, because it’s only its raal prisince that’s
in it. But that appearance that you call a cork,’ says he,
‘is nothing but the outward spacies and external qualities
of the cortical nathur. Them’s nothing but the accidents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
of the cork that you’re looking at and handling; but, as
I tould you afore, the raal cork’sdhrew, and is here prisint
on the end ov this nate little insthrument, and it was the
noise I made in dhrawing it, and nothing else, that you
mistook for the sound ov the <i>pogue</i>.’</p>

<p>“You know there was no conthravaning what he said,
and the Pope couldn’t openly deny it. Howandiver he
thried to pick a hole in it this way.</p>

<p>“‘Granting,’ says he, ‘that there is the differ you say
betuxt the raality ov the cork and them cortical accidents,
and that it’s quite possible, as you allidge, that the thrue
cork is raaliy prisint on the end ov the shcrew, while the
accidents keep the mouth of the bottle stopped; still,’
says he, ‘I can’t undherstand, though willing to acquit
you, how the dhrawing ov the raal cork, that’s onpalpable
and widout accidents, could produce the accident ov that
sinsible explosion I heard jist now.’</p>

<p>“‘All I can say,’ says his riv’rence, ‘is that I’m sinsible
it was a raal accident, anyhow.’</p>

<p>“‘Ay,’ says the Pope, ‘the kiss you gev Eliza, you
mane.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ says his riv’rence, ‘but the report I made.’”</p>

<h3>THE STUDENT OF UPSALA.</h3>

<p>Mary Howitt, in her “Frederika Bremer and her
Swedish Sisters,” repeats the pleasant story of a university
student at Upsala in the early part of the present
century. He was the son of a poor widow, and was
standing with some of his college companions in one of
the public walks on a fine Sunday morning. As they
were thus standing, the young daughter of the governor,
a good and beautiful girl, was seen approaching them on
her way to church, accompanied by her governess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly the widow’s son exclaimed, “I am sure that
young girl would give me a kiss!”</p>

<p>His companions laughed, and one of them, a rich
young fellow, said, “It is impossible! Thou an utter
stranger, and in a public thoroughfare! It is too absurd
to think of.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I am confident of what I say,” returned
the other.</p>

<p>The rich student offered to lay a heavy wager that, so
far from succeeding, he would not even venture to propose
such a thing.</p>

<p>Taking him at his word, the poor student, the moment
the young lady and her attendant had passed, followed
them, and politely addressing them, they stopped, on
which, in a modest and straightforward manner, he said,
speaking to the governor’s daughter, “It entirely rests
with Fröken to make my fortune.”</p>

<p>“How so?” demanded she, greatly amazed.</p>

<p>“I am a poor student,” said he, “the son of a widow.
If Fröken would condescend to give me a kiss, I should
win a large sum of money, which, enabling me to continue
my studies, would relieve my mother of a great
anxiety.”</p>

<p>“If success depend on so small a thing,” said the
innocent girl, “I can but comply;” and therewith,
sweetly blushing, she gave him a kiss, just as if he had
been her brother.</p>

<p>Without a thought of wrong-doing, the young girl went
to church, and afterwards told her father of the encounter.</p>

<p>The next day the governor summoned the bold student
to his presence, anxious to see the sort of person who had
thus dared to accost his daughter. But the young man’s
modest demeanor at once favorably impressed him. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
heard his story, and was so well pleased that he invited
him to dine at the castle twice a week.</p>

<p>In about a year the young lady married the student
whose fortune she had thus made, and who is at the present
day a celebrated Swedish philologist. His amiable
wife died a few years since.</p>

<h3>TUNNEL STORIES.</h3>

<p>The well-known court-plaster incident is said to have
occurred in one of the tunnels of the Hudson River Railroad.
A very pretty lady was seated opposite to a good-looking
gentleman who was accompanying a party to
Saratoga Springs. It was observed that this exceedingly
handsome young woman had the smallest bit of court-plaster
on a slight abrasion of the surface of her red upper
lip. As the cars rumbled into the darkness of the tunnel,
a slight exclamation of “Oh!” was heard from the lady,
and when the cars again emerged into the light, the little
piece of court-plaster aforesaid had become in some mysterious
manner transferred to the upper lip of the young
gentleman! Curious, was it not?</p>

<p>A Western youth played a trick on two school-girls
returning home for vacation, which is thus reported:</p>

<p>Occupying a seat on the train just back of them, he
entered into a flirtation which was in no way discouraged.
The train came to a dark tunnel, and when it got midway
he kissed the back of his own hand audibly,—gave it a
regular buss. Each girl, of course, charged the other
with guilt, and the passengers thought possibly the youth
had kissed both. When they got home, each told the
joke on the other, and for the first time two girls have
the credit of having been kissed without having enjoyed
that pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>A similar story, but with an improvement, is told of
Horace Vernet, the eminent painter.</p>

<p>The artist was going from Versailles to Paris by railway.
In the same compartment with him were two ladies
whom he had never seen before, but who were evidently
acquainted with him. They examined him minutely, and
commented freely upon his martial bearing, his hale old
age, the style of his dress, etc. They continued their
annoyance until finally the painter determined to put an
end to the persecution. As the train passed through the
tunnel of St. Cloud, the three travellers were wrapped in
complete darkness. Vernet raised the back of his hand
to his mouth, and kissed it twice violently. On emerging
from the obscurity, he found that the ladies had withdrawn
their attention from him, and were accusing each
other of having been kissed by a man in the dark!</p>

<p>Presently they arrived at Paris; and Vernet, on leaving
them, said, “Ladies, I shall be puzzled all my life by the
inquiry, <i>Which</i> of these two ladies was it that kissed me?”</p>

<p>A correspondent of one of the London morning
papers writes, “The following little incident which happened
the other day illustrates the necessity of providing
more light in the carriages of the Metropolitan Underground
Railway. A gentleman had taken his seat in a
second-class carriage which had already nine occupants.
On the side opposite to him sat one of the prettiest women
he had ever seen. She had entered the carriage accompanied
by an elderly gentleman, who seated himself opposite
to her, and whose attentions to the lady left little
doubt that they stood to one another in the relation of
husband and wife. The light was exceedingly dim when
they started. At Victoria Station, a boy, who sat next to
the elderly gentleman, got out. In consequence of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
departure of the boy there was a moving up of the tightly-wedged
passengers on that side of the carriage, and the
gentleman whom I first mentioned was thus brought right
opposite to the lady whose beauty had already attracted
his attention, and sat in the position originally occupied
by her elderly companion. From Victoria to South Kensington
they were left in total darkness, and this is what
happened, in the words of the narrator: ‘A light little
hand was laid on my shoulder; I felt a sweet warm breath
fan my face; a pair of the softest, most perfect lips were
pressed to mine with a delicious sensation which I cannot
describe. Then a little hand slid down my arm, thrilling
every nerve in my body, and finally deposited three
lozenges in my hand. As we neared the lights of South
Kensington Station, the hand was withdrawn. May the
gentleman on my left ever remain in blissful ignorance of
the mistake made by his better half in the darkness of
that tunnel.’ Let us echo that wish, and hope that the
secret of three lozenges was never divulged. Under certain
circumstances darkness has its advantages,—that is
to say, if you are not travelling with your wife.”</p>

<p>Those who have read “The Newcomes” will probably
remember the following passage:</p>

<p>“A young gentleman and a young lady a-kissing of
each other in the railway coach,” says Hannah, jerking
up with her finger to the ceiling, as much as to say,
“There she is! Lar, she be a pretty young creature, that
she be! and so I told Miss Martha.” Thus differently
had the news which had come to them on the previous
night affected the old lady and her maid.</p>

<p>The news was that Miss Newcome’s maid (a giddy
thing from the country, who had not even learned as yet
to hold her tongue) had announced with giggling delight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
to Lady Ann’s maid that Mr. Clive had given Miss Ethel
a kiss in the tunnel, and she supposed it was a match.</p>

<p>Clive, we are told, did not know whether to laugh or
to be in a rage over this report. He evidently felt called
upon, however, to swear that he was as innocent of all
intention of kissing Miss Ethel as of embracing Queen
Elizabeth.</p>

<h3>AN AMOROUS WESTERN YOUTH.</h3>

<p>A young Montana chap upon stepping aboard of a
sleeping-car thus addressed the conductor:</p>

<p>“See here, captain, I want one of your best bunks for
this young woman, and one for myself individually.
<i>One</i> will do for us when we get to the Bluff,—hey,
Mariar?” (Here he gave a playful poke at “Mariar,”
to which she replied, “Now, John, quit.”) “For, you
see, we’re goin’ to git married at Mariar’s uncle’s. We
might ’a bin married at Montanny, but we took a habit
to wait till we got to the Bluff, bein’ Mariar’s uncle is a
minister, and they charge a goshfired price for hitchin’
folks at Montanny.”</p>

<p>“Mariar” was assigned to one of the best “bunks.”
During a stoppage of the train at a station, the voice of
John was heard in pleading accents, unconscious that the
train had stopped, and that his tones could be heard
throughout the car:</p>

<p>“Now, Mariar, you might give a feller jes one.”</p>

<p>“John, you quit, or I’ll git out right here, and hoof it
back to Montanny in the snow-storm.”</p>

<p>“Only one little kiss, Mariar, and I hope to die if I
don’t——”</p>

<p>“John——!”</p>

<p>At this moment an old gray-beard poked his head out
of his berth, at the other end of the car, and cried out,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>“Maria, for pity’s sake, <i>give</i> John one kiss, so that we
can go to sleep sometime to-night!”</p>

<p>Thereupon John subsided, and retired to his berth to
dream of the distinction between the hesitancy of the
kiss of courtship and the freedom of the kiss connubial.</p>

<h3>LOVE IN A STREET-CAR.</h3>

<p>A Baltimore writer narrates the following amusing
incident:</p>

<p>Having business that required my attention in the
northwestern section of the city until a late hour, I, at
half-past eleven o’clock, found myself seated in a Madison
Avenue car. At the crossing of Franklin and Eutaw
Streets a young couple entered the car, and occupied a
seat in the corner opposite myself. Being a great admirer
of the fair sex, I stole a glance at the lady, and was
recompensed by beholding a very handsome young miss,
with black hair and eyes,—the latter appearing as if Cupid
had rented the premises and was determined to dispute
the sway of man. Her companion was a biped attired in
a new suit of Harrison Street store clothes, as gay as a
peacock. The first thing he did after seating himself was
to encircle the neck of the lady with his left arm, while
his right hand lovingly grasped her left. Not being used
to such scenes (being a bachelor), I kept my t’other eye
open, and noted down the proceedings in my mind.</p>

<p>“Clara,” began the passionate lover, “ain’t this nice?
I swon, it’s a good deal better’n ridin’ in the old wagin!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Josh,” feebly articulated Clara. “But don’t
hug me so; the folks are lookin’ at us.”</p>

<p>“Well, let ’em look!” retorted Josh. “Guess they’d
like tu be in my place a spell, ennyhow!” (I, for one,
did most heartily envy him the position.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; but, Josh, you know they will laugh at us,”
meekly rejoined his companion.</p>

<p>“Let ’em laugh!” exclaimed the irate lover. “Don’t
I love you, and don’t you love me, and ain’t we a-goin’
to git married to-morrer?”</p>

<p>Josh at this moment appeared as though a brilliant idea
had struck him, for he suddenly bent over and kissed his
fair companion squarely in the mouth.</p>

<p>“There!” said he, exultingly; “ain’t that nice? You
don’t allers git them sort!” Then, turning to the occupants
of the car, he exclaimed, “Strangers, me and this
young woman have come down from the country to git
married. She is a nice gal, and I’m a-goin’ to do the
right thing by her!”</p>

<p>During the delivery of this concise speech, Clara’s face
was suffused with blushes; noticing which, her ardent
lover remarked, “Don’t git so all-fired red about the
gills, Clara. You know that we are a-goin’ to be married;
and what’s the use to fluster up so?”</p>

<p>This last speech settled the business of the passengers.
They gave one shout, and relieved themselves of a charge
of laughter that had almost strangled them. At the next
corner I vacated the car, leaving the happy couple as
contented as if the future denoted nothing but sunshine.</p>

<h3>TAKING TOLL.</h3>

<p>A gentleman of an autobiographic turn relates how he
was instructed in the custom of taking toll, by a sprightly
widow, during a moonlight sleigh-ride with a merry party.
He says:</p>

<p>The lively widow L. sat in the same sleigh, under the
same buffalo-robe, with me.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! don’t, don’t!” she exclaimed, as we came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
to the first bridge, at the same time catching me by the
arm and turning her veiled face towards me, while her
little eyes twinkled through the moonlight.</p>

<p>“Don’t what?” I asked. “I’m not doing anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, but I thought you were going to take toll,”
replied the widow.</p>

<p>“<i>Toll!</i>” I rejoined. “What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” cried the widow, her clear laugh
ringing out above the music of the bells, “you pretend
you don’t know what toll is!”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t, then,” I said, laughing; “explain,
if you please.”</p>

<p>“You never heard, then,” said the widow, most provokingly,—“you
never heard that when we are on a
sleigh-ride the gentlemen always,—that is, sometimes,—when
they cross a bridge, claim a kiss, and call it toll.
But I never pay it.”</p>

<p>I said that I had never heard of it before; but when
we came to the next bridge I claimed the toll, and the
widow’s struggles to hold the veil over her face were not
enough to tear it. At last the veil was removed, her
round, rosy face was turned directly towards mine, and in
the clear light of a frosty moon the toll was taken, for
the first time in my experience. Soon we came to a long
bridge, with several arches; the widow said it was of no
use to resist a man who would have his own way, so she
paid the toll without a murmur.</p>

<p>“But you won’t take toll for every arch, <i>will</i> you?”
she said, so archly that I could not fail to exact all my
dues; and that was the beginning of my courtship.</p>

<h3>SUDDEN ATTACHMENT.</h3>

<p>It is related of Curran, the famous Irish orator and
wit, that he was one evening sitting in a box at the French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
Opera, between an Irish noblewoman, whom he had
accompanied there, and a very young French lady. The
ladies soon manifested a strong desire to converse, but
neither of them knew a word of the other’s language.
Curran, of course, volunteered to interpret, or, in his
own words, “to be the carrier of their thoughts, and
accountable for their safe delivery.” They went at it at
once, with all the ardor and zest of the Irish and French
nature combined; but their interpreter took the liberty of
substituting his own thoughts for theirs, and instead of
remarks upon the dresses and the play he introduced so
many finely-turned compliments that the two ladies soon
became completely fascinated with each other. At last,
their enthusiasm becoming sufficiently great, the wily interpreter,
in conveying some very innocent questions from
his countrywoman, asked the French lady “if she would
favor her with a kiss.” Instantly springing across the
orator, she imprinted a kiss on each cheek of the Irish
lady, who was amazed at her sudden attack, and often
afterwards asked Mr. Curran, “What in the world could
that French girl have meant by such conduct in such a
place?” He never revealed the secret, and the Irish lady
always thought French girls were very ardent and sudden
in their attachments.</p>

<h3>EARLY DISCRIMINATION.</h3>

<p>A judicious mother told her little girls they must not
be hanging around and kissing the young gentlemen who
visited the house; it was not becoming in them, and it
might be troublesome. A few days afterwards an old
gentleman, a friend of the family, called, and, while
noticing the children, drew one of them to him and
offered to kiss the little thing. But no, she would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
nothing of the sort; and when the gentleman was gone,
the mother said,—</p>

<p>“My dear, when a nice old gentleman like that offers
to kiss a little girl like you, you shouldn’t put on such
airs and refuse him. I was quite ashamed of your conduct.”</p>

<p>“But, mother, you told us we mustn’t kiss the gentlemen,”
said Maggie.</p>

<p>“Maggie, there is a great difference between letting
young men kiss you, and such old people as Mr. Venable
who just went out. When such persons offer to kiss you,
it is to show their kind feelings, and you should take it as
a compliment, and not act foolishly.”</p>

<p>Maggie put on a very serious face, and, after thinking
upon it awhile, replied, “Well, mother, if I <i>have</i> to kiss
the gentlemen, I would a great deal rather kiss the young
ones.”</p>

<p>Children and fools speak the truth.</p>

<h3>THE BAFFLED COURTIER.</h3>

<p>The “Book of Merrie Jests” relates in the quaintness
of a century or two ago how that the wonderful Sir Digby
Somerville did keep constantly a houseful of grand
company at his seat in Suffolk. At one time among his
guests did happen a young gentleman from the court,
whose apparel was more garnished with lacings and gold
than his brain with modesty or wit. One time, going into
the fields with his host, they did espy a comely milkmaiden
with her pail.</p>

<p>“Pr’ythee, Phyllis,” quoth the courtier, leering the
while at the girl, “an I give thee a kiss, wilt thou give
me a draught of thy ware?”</p>

<p>“In the meadow,” quoth she, “thou wilt find one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
ready to give thee milk, and glad of thy kiss, for she is
of thy kind.”</p>

<p>The court-gallant looked in the meadow, and espied a
she-ass.</p>

<p>“So sharp, fair rustic!” quoth he, angrily: “thou lookest
as if thou couldst barely say boo to a goose.”</p>

<p>“Yea, and that I can, and to a gander also.” Whereat
she cried out lustily, “Boo!”</p>

<p>The young man hastened away, and the worshipful Sir
Digby did laugh heartily, and entertained his guests with
the tale.</p>

<h3>A THANKFUL SPIRIT.</h3>

<p>The chronicles of the time of John Brown of Haddington,
author of the “Marrow of Divinity,” describe
his first osculatory experience. He had reached the
mature age of five-and-forty without ever having taken
part in labial exercises. One of his deacons had a very
charming daughter, and for six years the dominie had
found it very pleasant to call upon her three or four times
a week. In fact, all the neighbors said he was courting
her; and very likely he was, though he had not the remotest
suspicion of it himself.</p>

<p>One evening he was sitting as usual by her side, when
a sudden idea popped into his head.</p>

<p>“Janet, my woman,” said he, “we’ve known each
other a long time, an’—an’—I’ve never got a kiss yet.
D’ye, think I may take one, my bonnie lass?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Brown,” replied she, arching her lips in a
tempting way, “jist as ye like; only be becomin’ and
proper wi’ it.”</p>

<p>“Let us ask a blessing first,” said the good man, closing
his eyes and folding his hands. “For what we are
about to receive, the Lord make us thankful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>The chaste salute was then given and warmly returned.</p>

<p>“Oh, Janet, that <i>was</i> good!” cried the dominie, electrified
by the new sensation. “Let us have another, and
then return thanks.”</p>

<p>Janet did not refuse, and when the operation had been
repeated, the enraptured dominie ejaculated, in a transport
of joy, “For the creature comforts which we have now
enjoyed, the Lord be praised, and may they be sanctified
to our temporal and eternal good!”</p>

<p>History says that the fervent petition of the honest
dominie was duly answered; for in less than a month
Janet became Mrs. Brown.</p>

<h3>A CLERGYMAN’S JOKE.</h3>

<p>A gentleman who was travelling in the West a few
years ago relates this amusing incident:</p>

<p>I was spending the night in a hotel in Freeport, Illinois.
After breakfast I came into the sitting-room, where I met
a pleasant, chatty, good-humored traveller, who, like
myself, was waiting for the morning train from Galena.
We conversed freely and pleasantly on several topics,
until, seeing two young ladies meet and kiss each other
in the street, the conversation turned on <i>kissing</i>, just
about the time the train was approaching.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he, taking up his carpet-bag, “since we
are on so sweet a subject, let us have a practical application.
I’ll make a proposition to you. I’ll agree to kiss
the most beautiful lady in the cars from Galena, you being
the judge, if you will kiss the next prettiest, I being the
judge.”</p>

<p>The proposition staggered me a little, and I could
hardly tell whether he was in earnest or in fun; but, as he
would be as deep in it as I could possibly be, I agreed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
provided he would do the first kissing, though my heart
failed somewhat as I saw his black eye fairly sparkle with
daring.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “I’ll try it first. You take the back
car, and go in from the front end, where you can see the
faces of the ladies, and you stand by the one you think
the handsomest, and I’ll come in from behind and kiss
her.”</p>

<p>I had hardly stepped inside the car when I saw at the
first glance one of the loveliest-looking women my eye
ever fell upon,—a beautiful blonde, with auburn hair,
and a bright, sunny face, full of love and sweetness, and
as radiant and glowing as the morning. Any further
search was totally unnecessary. I immediately took my
stand in the aisle of the car by her side. She was looking
out of the window earnestly, as if expecting some
one. The back door of the car opened, and in stepped
my hotel friend. I pointed my finger slyly to her, never
dreaming that he would dare to carry out his pledge; and
you may imagine my horror and amazement when he
stepped up quickly behind her, and, stooping over, kissed
her with a relish that made my mouth water from end to
end.</p>

<p>I expected of course a shriek of terror, and then a row
generally, and a knock-down; but astonishment succeeded
astonishment when I saw her return the kisses with compound
interest.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash he turned to me, and said, “Now, sir,
it is your turn;” pointing to a hideously ugly, wrinkled
old woman who sat in the seat behind.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must excuse me! you must excuse me!” I
exclaimed. “I’m sold this time. I give up. Do tell
me whom you have been kissing.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “since you are a man of so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
taste and such quick perception, I’ll let you off.” And
we all burst into a general peal of laughter, as he said,
“This is my wife! I have been waiting here for her. I
knew that was a safe proposition.” He told the story to
his wife, who looked tenfold sweeter as she heard it.</p>

<p>Before we reached Chicago, we exchanged cards, and I
discovered that my genial companion was a popular Episcopalian
preacher whose name I had frequently heard.</p>

<h3>“LET ME KISS HIM FOR HIS MOTHER.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></h3>

<p>Among the funny incidents that took place during the
late sectional conflict between the States is one that is
thus recorded:</p>

<p>A young lady of the gushing sort, while passing through
one of the military hospitals, overheard the remark that
a young lieutenant had died that morning.</p>

<p>“Oh, where is he? Let me see him! Let me kiss him
for his mother!” exclaimed the maiden.</p>

<p>The attendant led her into an adjoining ward, when,
discovering Lieutenant H., of the Fifth Kansas, lying
fast asleep on his hospital couch, and thinking to have a
little fun, he pointed him out to the girl. She sprang
forward, and, bending over him, said:</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear lieutenant, let me kiss you for your
mother!”</p>

<p>What was her surprise when the awakened “corpse”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
ardently clasped her in his arms, returned the salute with
interest, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Never mind the old lady, miss; go it on your own
account. I haven’t the slightest objection.”</p>

<p>From the lyrics perpetrated by the “satirical wags”
during the popularity of the above well-known phrase,
we cite the following:</p>

<h3>THE AWAKENING.</h3>

<p>An adventure befell a Tennessee poet, which he narrates
in very moving verse, but which we transmute into
plain prose. He had been hunting, one sultry day, and,
being very tired, lay down under a shady tree, with his
faithful dog by his side. He there fell asleep, and dreamed
the orthodox dream of all young poets. A maiden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
“beautiful exceedingly” approached him, and, after a
very brief wooing, expressed a perfect willingness to bless
the poet with her affections. Hereupon,—but plain prose
cannot do justice to the <i>dénouement</i>, so we must give it in
the poet’s own verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I kissed her, but,—oh, shocking!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I kissed a beard so rough!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Surprised, half choked, awaking,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ah, broken was the charm;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There lay—will you believe it?—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>My pointer on my arm.</i></div>

<h3>JEAN PAUL’S SCHOOL-BOY EXPERIENCE.</h3>

<p>When Jean Paul was first sent to school, a mischievous
boy, taking advantage of his inexperience, told him that
it was an established custom for each pupil, when he first
entered, to kiss the hand of the master. This seemed to
Paul but a suitable custom, and by no means extraordinary,
as in his own family it was an established expression
of reverence from the young to the old, and Paul,
whenever he went to his grandfather’s, kissed his hand
behind the loom. When he entered the French school,
therefore, he bashfully approached the master, and, with
honest faith, carried the brawny hand to his lips.</p>

<p>The poor Frenchman,—an indifferent and poorly-paid
instructor, who had been a tapestry-worker,—suspecting
some mystification or insult, broke out into the most
violent anger, and Paul barely escaped a blow from the
hand on which he had imprinted his loyal homage. The
mirth of the class was expressed in a jubilant manner,
and, between them both, Paul stood confused, ashamed,
and in the highest degree mortified.</p>

<p>In this instance, we are told, he was taken by surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
and betrayed by his loyal nature; but in another attempt
to impose upon him he asserted his rank as a scholar with
a degree of firmness and dignity that compelled respect
ever after.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST KISS.</h3>

<p>Who has forgotten the emotions inspired by the first
kiss? Pierce Pungent has exhausted himself in a vain
attempt to describe what may be remembered, but cannot
and should not be told. He says:</p>

<p>“We never believed Pope’s line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Die of a rose in aromatic pain,’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">till we once accidentally got a kiss awarded to us at a
game of forfeits, some fifty years ago. <i>Eheu! fugaces!</i>
The fair one in question was the secret idol of our soul.
Oh, those cerulean eyes! those flowing silken tresses!
those ruby lips! that exquisite form!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Her presence was as lofty as her state;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her beauty of that overpowering kind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose force description only would abate:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I’d rather leave it much to your own mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than lessen it by what I could relate</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of form and feature.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“But we must tear ourself away from these charms
and return to our mutton, or, rather, our lamb, for our
heart’s worship was only eighteen cents a pound,—confound
the butchers! the high price of meat has confused
our notions,—we mean she was only eighteen years of
age. When we found ourself entitled to a kiss by the
sacred game of forfeits, the keenness of the rapture
almost grew into a toothache. A kiss seemed more than
we could manage; it grew into Titanic dimensions. We
had a vague notion of asking the company to help us out
by sharing our bliss, as the school-boy who, when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
hears of his two-hundred-pound cake being on the road,
promises all his comrades a slice, but when it arrives he
keeps it all to himself!</p>

<p>“A kiss from Mary! and all to our own cheek! Oh!
and then the blushing shame of a first love, vulgarly called
calf, came over us, and we stood looking at our Mary’s
lips as a thief does at the gallows! Oh! those sunny
eyes! Oh, those luxuriant tresses! as she shook them off
her radiant face, as a dove shakes her feathers and a dog
his hide, in order to leave more cheek to kiss! Oh, those
provoking lips, pursed up ready, like the peak of Teneriffe,
to catch the first kiss of love, that rosy light from
heaven! Oh, that circling dimple, couched in her cheek
like laughing wile! And oh! that moment when she
said, ‘Well, if Cousin Pierce won’t kiss me, I’ll kiss
him!’ She stooped down,—my sight grew dim,—my
heart beat fast, as though I had swallowed a dose of
prussic acid; her lips touched mine; the world slid away,
as it does when we soar in a balloon; and we were carried
away into a calm delirium, which has never altogether
left us.”</p>

<h3>KISSING THE FEET.</h3>

<p>Seneca tells us that Caius Cæsar gave wine to Pompey
Pennus, whom he had pardoned, and then, on his returning
thanks, presented his left foot for him to kiss. This
custom is still practised in Oriental countries, where it is
regarded as a mark of the deepest reverence and most
profound humility. Don Juan, in his feminine disguise,
disdainfully refused such subjection, even to the Sultana:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Motioned to Juan to approach, and then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A second time desired him to kneel down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And kiss the lady’s foot; which maxim when</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He heard repeated, Juan with a frown</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Drew himself up to his full height again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And said, ‘It grieved him, but he could not stoop</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Finally the matter was compromised by kissing the
hand, the proud Castilian promptly acknowledging the
requirement of a common courtesy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For through the South the custom still commands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gentleman to kiss the lady’s hands.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sir R. K. Porter, the Eastern traveller, tells the readers
of his interesting sketches of a Persian who was not only
not so fastidious, but ludicrously otherwise in the depth
of his self-abasement. Says Sir Robert, “I took a lancet
out of my pocket-book, put it into his hands, and told
him it was for himself. He looked at me, and at it, with

of my parting with such a jewel. But when I repeated
the words, ‘It is yours,’ he threw himself on the
ground, kissed my knees and my feet, and wept with a
joy that stifled his expression of thanks.”</p>

<h3>ALL-EMBRACING INCLUSION.</h3>

<p>In that old-fashioned youthful game, “Kiss in the
Ring,” a favorite manœuvre of some of the boys was to
keep out of a place in the ring till they had kissed all the
pretty girls in succession. Those who grow up with the
same fondness for osculatory attentions would probably
like the custom in some parts of Germany, which requires
a young man who is engaged to a girl to salute, upon
making his adieu for the evening, the whole of the family,
beginning with the mother. Thus, in a family circle
embracing half a dozen girls, each having a lover, no less
than forty-eight kisses would have to be given on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
occasion of a united meeting; and when we consider that
each lover would give his own sweetheart ten times as
many kisses as he gave her sisters, the grand total would
outnumber a hundred!</p>

<h3>A KISS IN THE DARK.</h3>

<p>In Buckstone’s very amusing farce, “A Kiss in the
Dark,” the jealous Pettibone tries a foolish stratagem in
order to confirm his unjust suspicions of Mrs. P.’s constancy:</p>

<p><i>Frank</i> (<i>reading note</i>). “Continue your attentions.”
Certainly, as you request it. (<i>Draws close to her; <span class="smcap">Pettibone</span>
again darts in; they retreat as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Pettibone.</i> Shan’t go out at all—I tell you I shan’t go
out at all—to-morrow will do. (<i>Sits in centre.</i>) You’ve
done as I bid you, I see—eh?—ah, ah, ah! (<i>Aside.</i>) I
think the last time I left the room he kissed her! I could
almost swear I heard the squeak of a little kiss. Oh, if I
could be convinced! I’ll conceal my feelings till I’m
<i>quite</i> satisfied—<i>quite</i> sure; and then——Betsey, dear,
if that note you were writing just now is for any one in
the city, I’ll leave it for you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> No, no, thank you, it is not worth the trouble,
and you wouldn’t be so mean as to defraud the
revenue of a penny.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> How they look at each other! I’ve a great mind
to jump up and tell ’em both how they’ve deceived me.
No, I won’t. I’ll set a trap for them—show ’em what
they are: ah! a good thought—I have it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Selim, what’s the matter with you, this evening?</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Nothing; I’ve been vexed,—city business. I
think, as I have a moment to spare, I’ll drop a note to
the wine merchant about the empty bottles (<i>takes inkstand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
to a table</i>): he ought to fetch ’em away, or I shall be
charged for ’em. What horrid candles! (<i>Snuffs one out.</i>)
Why did I go to the expense of a handsome lamp, when
you will burn candles? (<i>In trying to light it he purposely
extinguishes the other; stage dark.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> P., dear, how clumsy you are!</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Sit still—I’ll get a light; Mary’s cooking—I’ll
get a light. (<i>He pours some ink on his pocket-handkerchief,
and in passing <span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span>, contrives to leave a large patch on
her nose.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> P., what are you doing?</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Nothing, dear, nothing; sit still. I’ll fetch a
light.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> Is it really your wish that I should continue my
attentions? (<i>Getting close to her.</i>) Gad, she’s a fine
woman, and I never in my life could be in the dark with
one, without giving her a kiss; and, encouraged as I am,
who could resist?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Attempts to kiss her.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Don’t, don’t; I won’t allow it; how can you
be so foolish? (<i>Kisses her, and blacks his nose.</i>) Go away:
here’s P. (<i>Lights up; <span class="smcap">Frank</span> returns to his chair as <span class="smcap">P.</span>
enters, stands between them moonstruck at seeing <span class="smcap">Frank’s</span>
face; he trembles, places one candle on the table, and seizes
<span class="smcap">Mrs. P.’s</span> arm.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Woman, look at that man—look at his nose. Now
go to your room—to the glass, and look at your own!
come, madam, come.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>He drags her off.</i></p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> Very strange conduct; however, my poor friend
is severely punished for the pains he has taken to test his
wife’s constancy....</p>

<p>In the <i>dénouement</i> the position of Mrs. P. and Frank is
explained:</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Not Betsey!—the lady I’ve pulled about so—not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
Betsey! Who are you, madam? Explain, before I faint
away—who are you?</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> That lady, sir, is my wife. (<i><span class="smcap">Frank</span> and <span class="smcap">Lady</span>
embrace.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Your wife! and really you are not going to elope?—you
are still your own Pettibone’s?—but that kiss in
the dark, madam! what can remove that stain?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> My candid confession——</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Of what?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> That I overheard the test by which I was to
be tried, and, knowing in my heart that I did not deserve
such a trial, I was resolved, as you had thought proper to
suspect me without a cause, for once to give you a reason
for your jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> (<i>on his knees.</i>) Oh, Betsey, forgive me....</p>

<p>The city of Nashville boasts of a smiling-contest, as
an adjunct to a Presbyterian church fair. There were
three competitors, young men, and a judge to decide
which of them smiled most sweetly. Three trials were
had, the contestants standing on a platform in full view
of the assembly, with a strong light thrown on their
faces. Louis Tillichet was declared the winner of the
prize, which was the privilege of kissing any one of the
girls attending the candy-counter, where the prettiest
daughters of the church were engaged.</p>

<p>A lady asked her little boy, “Have you called your
grandma to tea?” “Yes. When I went to call her she
was asleep, and I didn’t wish to halloo at grandma, nor
shake her; so I kissed her cheek, and that woke her very
softly. Then I ran into the hall, and said, pretty loud,
‘Grandma, tea is ready.’ And she never knew what
woke her up.”</p>

<h3>A BUDGET OF FACETIÆ.</h3>

<p>A Columbia clergyman, who, while preaching a sermon
on Sunday evening, perceived a man and woman under
the gallery in the act of kissing each other behind a hymn-book,
did not lose his temper. No! he remained calm.
He beamed mildly at the offenders over his spectacles,
and when the young man kissed her the fifteenth time, he
merely broke his sermon short off in the middle of
“thirdly,” and offered a fervent prayer in behalf of “the
young man in the pink neck-tie and the maiden in the
blue bonnet and gray shawl, who were profaning the
sanctuary by kissing one another in pew seventy-eight.”
And the congregation said “Amen.” Then the woman
pulled her veil down, and the young man sat there and
swore softly to himself. He does not go to church as
much now as he did.</p>

<p>At Boulogne, during the reception of Queen Victoria,
some years ago, a number of English ladies, in their
anxiety to see everything, pressed with such force against
the soldiers who were keeping the line that the latter
were forced to give way, and generally were—to use the
expression of policemen—“hindered in the execution of
their duty.” The officer in command, observing the
state of affairs, called out, “One roll of the drum,—if
they don’t keep back, kiss them all.” After the first
sound of the drum the ladies took to flight. “If they
had been French,” said a Parisian journal, “they would
have remained to a woman.”</p>

<p>The portrait-painter, Gilbert Stuart, once met a lady
in Boston, who said to him, “I have just seen your likeness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>

“And did it kiss you in return?” said he. “No,” replied
the lady. “Then,” returned the gallant painter,
“it was not like me.”</p>

<p>Mary Kyle Dallas says love-making is always awkward.
“A stolen kiss, if seen, creates a laugh; a squeeze
of the hand, if detected, is a great joy. I myself, who
claim to be romantic, did grin at a shadow picture cast
upon the wall of the white garden fence, next door, by
an envious gas-light, when I saw the shadow of the young
lady with much waterfall feed the shadow of the young
gentleman with no whiskers with sugar-plums and then
kiss it; but the shadows were very black, and took odd
crinks in their noses as they moved to and fro, and that
may have been the cause of my mirth.”</p>

innocent and unconscious that the old gentleman concluded
that his ears had deceived him, and so retired
from the scene without a word.</p>

<p>A young lady of Cincinnati, who had just returned from
completing her education in Boston, wanted to kiss her
lover, but her mother objected. The daughter drew up
her queenly form to its full height, and exclaimed,
“Mother, terrible, tragical, and sublimely retributive
will be the course pursued by me, if you refuse to allow
him to place his alabaster lips to mine, and enrapture my
immortal soul by imprinting angelic sensations of divine
bliss upon the indispensable members of my human physiognomy,
and then kindly allowing me to take a withdrawal
from his beneficent presence.” The mother feebly
admitted that her objections were overruled.</p>

for?’ Marforio answers, ‘Abaciar la Santa Croce’”—to
kiss the Holy Cross.</p>

the birth of the Duke of Burgundy, all were welcomed to
kiss the royal hand. The Marquis of Spinola, in the

king started, when Spinola begged pardon, and said in his
defence that if he had not done so his majesty would
not have noticed him.</p>

<p>An engaged young gentleman got rather neatly out of
a scrape with his intended. She taxed him with having
kissed two young ladies at some party at which she was
not present. He owned it, but said that their united ages
only made twenty-one. The simple-minded girl thought
of ten and eleven, and laughed off her pout. He did
not explain that one was nineteen and the other two years
of age! Wasn’t it artful? Just like the men!</p>

through Durham Castle, were escorted by an elderly
female of a sour, solemn, and dignified aspect. In the
course of their peregrinations they came to the tapestry
for which the castle is famed. “These,” said the guide,
in true showman style, flavored with a dash of piety to
suit the subject, and pointing to several groups of figures
upon the tapestry, “these represent scenes in the life of
Jacob.” “Oh, yes,—how pretty!” said a young lady;
and, with a laugh, pointing to two figures in somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
close proximity, she continued, “I suppose that is Jacob
kissing Rachel?” “No, madam,” responded the indignant
guide, with crushing dignity, “that is <i>Jacob wrestling
with the angel</i>.” Amid a general smile the young lady
subsided, and offered no further expository remarks, but
groaned under a sense of unworthiness during the rest of
the visit.</p>

<p>A Carson (California) editor thus speaks of “Climatic
Influences:”</p>

<p>Last evening, after the dusky shadows of night had cast
a mantle over this part of the mundane sphere, we strolled
out upon one of Carson’s beautifully shaded avenues for
a walk. While pondering upon the uncertainty of everything
human, we came suddenly upon two persons, both
of whom were not of the same gender, standing one
upon either side of a gate, which seemed to require a
pressure of forty pounds to the square inch to keep it
from falling; but, strange to say, it remained upright
when they separated at our approach. Further on we
came in sight of a kind young man who was assisting a
poor lame girl with his arm around her waist. Not wishing
to investigate the matter further, we turned into the
next cross-street, but had not proceeded more than a
block when we heard a sweet voice exclaim:</p>

<p>“Ed, if you kiss me again, I’ll call ma.”</p>

<p>Thinking how such things could be, we returned to our
sanctum, where reference to the “Chronicle” of yesterday
explains it. It is all in the climate, you know.</p>

refers to the newspaper fashion of giving a comic account

leaving a suggestive hiatus, making a conclusion which
connects the premises. Among the examples given is this
one:</p>

<p>Mr. Jones was observed by his wife through the window
to kiss the cook in the kitchen. Comment: “Mr. Jones
did not go out of the house for several days, and yet there
was no snow-storm.”</p>

<p>“I say, Mr. Smithers,” said Mrs. Smithers to her husband,
“didn’t I hear you down in the kitchen kissing the
cook?” “My dear,” replied Smithers, blandly, “permit
me to insist upon my right to be reasonably ignorant.
I really cannot say what you may have heard.” “But
wasn’t you down there kissing the cook?” “My dear,
I cannot really recollect. I only remember going into
the kitchen and coming out again. I may have been
there, and from what you say I infer I was. But I cannot
recollect just what occurred.” “But,” persisted the
ruthless cross-examiner, “what did Jane mean when she
said, ‘Oh! Smithers, don’t kiss so loud, or the old she-dragon
up-stairs will hear us’?” “Well,” said Smithers,
in his blandest tones, “I cannot remember what interpretation
I did put on the words at the time. They are
not my words, you must remember.”</p>

step being adjustable, so that a short girl can bring her
lips to the line of any given moustache without trouble.
If the gate is occupied at half-past ten <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, an iron hand

long and tedious, devotional, or what?” She said

<p>“Punch” publishes the following from its sensational
reporter: An appalling tragedy in domestic life has lately
scattered consternation in the neighborhood of Bayswater.
A newly-married couple, in possession of ample fortune,
and moving, it is rumored, in extremely good society,
had been observed to live together upon very loving
terms, and no suspicion as to their affection was entertained
among their friends. It appears, however, that on
Monday morning last the young husband left his wife in
considerable agitation, having, as he alleged, some business
in the city. It has since transpired that he had previously
secured himself a stall at Drury Lane for Salvini
in “Othello;” and there seems reason to believe that the
tragical event which subsequently happened was first suggested
to his mind by this most masterly performance. It
was noticed by the footman that he did not return until
a few minutes before his usual dinner-hour, when, rushing
in abruptly, without one word of warning, he proceeded
to the bed-chamber where his wife was in the act of dressing
for the evening, and before her startled maid could
even scream for help, he caught his wife up in his arms
in a frenzy of excitement and deliberately proceeded to
smother her—with kisses!</p>

<p>In that very amusing sketch, “Johnny Beedle’s Courtship,”
occurs the following droll scene:</p>

<p>“It is a good sign to find a girl sulky. I knew where
the shoe pinched: it was that ’are Patty Bean business.
So I went to work to persuade her that I had never had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
any notion after Patty, and, to prove it, I fell to running
her down at a great rate. Sally could not help chiming
in with me; and I rather guess Miss Patty suffered a few.
I now not only got hold of her hand without opposition,
but managed to slip my arm round her waist. But there
was no satisfying me; so I must go to poking out my lips
after a kiss. I guess I rued it. She fetched me a slap in
the face that made me see stars, and my ears rung like a
brass kettle for a quarter of an hour. I was forced to
laugh at the joke, though out of the wrong side of my
mouth, which gave my face something the look of a gridiron.
The battle now began in the regular way.</p>

<p>“‘Come, Sally, give me a kiss, and ha’ done with it
now?’</p>

<p>“‘I won’t! so there, you’—</p>

<p>“‘I’ll take it, whether or no.’</p>

<p>“‘Do it, if you dare!’</p>

<p>“And at it we went, rough and tumble. An odd destruction
of starch now commenced; the bow of my cravat
was squat up in half a shake. At the next bout, smash
went shirt-collar; and at the same time some of the head-fastenings
gave way, and down came Sally’s hair in a
flood like a mill-dam let loose, carrying away half a
dozen combs. One dig of Sally’s elbow, and my blooming
ruffles wilted down to a dish-cloth. But she had no
time to boast. Soon her neck-tackling began to shiver;
it parted at the throat, and away came a lot of blue and
white beads, scampering and running races every which
way about the floor.</p>

<p>“By the hookey, if Sally Jones is not real grit, there
is no snakes. She fought fair, however, I must own, and
neither tried to bite or scratch; and when she could fight
no longer she yielded handsomely. Her arms fell down
by her sides, her head back over her chair, her eyes closed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
and there lay her plump little mouth, all in the air. Lord,
did ye ever see a hawk pounce upon a young robin, or a
bumble-bee upon a clover-top? I say nothing.</p>

<p>“Consarn it, how a buss will crack of a still frosty
night! Mrs. Jones was about half-way between asleep
and awake.</p>

<p>“‘There goes my yeast-bottle,’ says she to herself, ‘bust
into twenty hundred pieces, and my bread is all dough
again.’”</p>

<h3>PRENTICEANA.</h3>

<p>The following epigrammatic hits are from the pen of
George D. Prentice, the late distinguished editor of the
“Louisville Journal”:</p>

<p>We once had a female correspondent who wrote,
“When two hearts are surcharged with love’s electricity,
a kiss is the burning contact, the wild leaping flame of
love’s enthusiasm.” This is certainly very pretty, but a
flash of electricity is altogether too brief to give a correct
idea of a truly delicious kiss. We agree with Byron that
the “strength” of a kiss is generally “measured by its
length.” Still, there should be a <i>limit</i>, and we really
think that Mrs. Browning, strong-minded woman as she
is, transcends all reasonable limits in her notion of a kiss’s
duration. Why, she talks in her “Aurora Leigh” of a
kiss</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“As long and silent as the ecstatic night.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That indeed must be “linked sweetness” altogether too
“long drawn out.”</p>

<p>An exchange says that we have a right to take an umbrella or a kiss without permission whenever we can.

<p>According to the New York “Express,” nine thousand

This was just seventy-five kisses to the minute, or considerably
more than one to the second. We are not altogether
sure that Mr. Clay, instead of kissing nine thousand
girls in two hours, would not have preferred to select the
prettiest one of the whole number and kiss <i>her</i> two hours.</p>

<h3>QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS.</h3>

<p>Kissing is not to be talked about; one practical demonstration
is worth a thousand prosaic descriptions. The
emotions of anger, fear, doubt, hope, and joy have been
appropriately described; but no one has done justice to
a warm, loving kiss. Among the attempts which have
been made is one by a young lady still in the dreamy
regions of girlhood. She sings,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let thy arms twine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Around me like a zone of love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thy fond lip, so soft,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To mine be passionately pressed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As it has been so oft.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is cold enough, surely. Here is something better;
the heart has made advances and speaks from experience:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“Sweetest love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Place thy dear arm beneath my drooping head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let me lowly nestle in thy heart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then turn those soul-lit orbs on me, and press</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My panting lips, to taste the ecstasy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imparted by each long and lingering kiss.”</div>

<p>Alexander Smith seems to have been electrified by a

who, upon taking too much apple-brandy, likened
his sensations to being on top of a meeting-house and
having every shingle turned into a Jew’s-harp. But let
us hear Alexander:</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">I seemed to walk on thrones!”</div>

<h3>THE PHILOSOPHY OF KISSING.</h3>

<p>What’s in a kiss? Really, when people come to reflect
upon the matter calmly, what can we see in a kiss? The
lips pout slightly and touch the cheek softly, and then
they just part, and the job is complete. There is a kiss in
the abstract! View it in the abstract, take it as it stands,
look at it philosophically, what is there in it? Millions
upon millions of souls have been made happy, while millions
upon millions have been plunged into misery and
despair, by this kissing; and yet when you look at the
character of the thing, it is simply pouting and parting
of the lips. In every grade of society there is kissing.
Go where you will,—to what country you will,—you are
perfectly sure to find kissing. There is, however, some
mysterious virtue in a kiss, after all.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s something in a kiss;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">If nothing else would prove it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It might be proved by this:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All honest people love it.</div>

<h3>THE SCIENCE OF KISSING.</h3>

<p>People will kiss, though not one in a hundred knows
how to extract bliss from lovely lips, any more than they
know how to make diamonds from charcoal; yet it is easy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
enough, at least for us. First know whom you are going
to kiss; don’t make a mistake, although a mistake may be
good. Don’t jump up like a trout for a fly and smack a
woman on the neck, or the ear, or the corner of her forehead,
or on the end of her nose. The gentleman should
be a little the taller; he should have a clean face, a kind
eye, and a mouth full of expression. Don’t kiss everybody;
don’t sit down to it; stand up; need not be anxious
about getting in a crowd. Two persons are plenty
to corner and catch a kiss; more persons would spoil the
sport. Take the left hand of the lady in your right; let
your hat go to—any place out of the way; throw the left
hand gently over the shoulder of the lady and let it fall
down the right side. Do not be in a hurry; draw her
gently, lovingly, to your heart. Her head will fall submissively
on your shoulder, and a handsome shoulder-strap
it makes. Do not be in a hurry. Her left hand is
in your right; let there be an impression to that, not like
the gripe of a vice, but a gentle clasp, full of electricity,
thought, and respect. Do not be in a hurry. Her head
lies carelessly on your shoulder; you are heart to heart.
Look down into her half-closed eyes; gently, but manfully,
press her to your bosom. Stand firm; be brave,
but don’t be in a hurry. Her lips are almost open; lean
slightly forward with your head, not the body; take good
aim; the lips meet; the eyes close; the heart opens; the
soul rides the storms, troubles, and sorrows of life (don’t
be in a hurry); heaven opens before you; the world
shoots under your feet as a meteor flashes across the
evening sky (don’t be afraid); the heart forgets its bitterness,
and the art of kissing is learned! No fuss, no noise,
no fluttering or squirming like that of hook-impaled
worms. Kissing doesn’t hurt, nor does it require an act
of Congress to make it legal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span></p>

<p>That reverend wag, Sydney Smith, says, “We are in
favor of a certain amount of shyness when a kiss is proposed;
but it should not be too long, and, when the fair
one gives it, let it be administered with warmth and
energy,—let there be soul in it. If she closes her eyes
and sigh immediately after it, the effect is greater. She
should be careful not to slobber a kiss, but give it as a
humming-bird runs his bill into a honeysuckle, deep but
delicate. There is much virtue in a kiss when well delivered.
We have the memory of one we received in our
youth, which lasted us forty years, and we believe it will
be one of the last things we shall think of when we die.”</p>

<h4>THE SOUND OF A KISS.</h4>

<p>A kiss is a difficult thing to describe on paper with
only the unyielding, unimpressible materials of pen and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
ink; but it has been courageously attempted by a wag
who had been at a wedding, “all of which he saw, and
part of which he was.” Having “seen it done and performed,
and heard the reverberation,” he describes a kiss
as follows:</p>

<p>“This is the age of improvement, ladies and gentlemen;
stand back and you will see <i>a kiss on paper</i>. Don’t
be incredulous. I will give you the sound in types.
Listen:</p>

<p>“When two pairs of affectionate lips are placed together
to the intent of osculation, the noise educed is
something like to the ensuing,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Epe-st’ weep’ st-e’ ee!</i></p>

<p class="noindent">and then the sound tapers off so softly and so musically
that no letters can do it justice.</p>

<p>“If any one thinks my description imperfect, let him
surpass it if he can, even with a pen made from a quill
out of Cupid’s wing.”</p>

<p>Another writer describes the acoustic phenomena of the
process in the following stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Men’s fancies have long been sore tasked</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Some simile meet to bestow</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the magical power of the touch,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">That poetical books are now filled.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But a thought rather novel occurs</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To my mind in regard to the sound:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is this,—that a kiss is just like</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The swell which in music is found.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Beginning most gently at first,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To the middle you gradually swell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then softly reduce to the close,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And, though luscious, take care not to dwell.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This gradual ascent to the swell</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Prepares for the climax of bliss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And letting one down as he rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Will weaken a fall such as this.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">This provision of nature most wise</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I have studied, and sagely conclude</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Certain death from excess to elude.</div>

<h3>THE DANGEROUS SIDE.</h3>

<h4>THE LEGAL VIEW.</h4>

<h5>POOR ENCOURAGEMENT.</h5>

<p>An Iowa school-teacher was discharged for the offence
of kissing a female assistant. Whereupon a local paper
inquired, “What inducement is there for any person to
exile himself to the country districts of Iowa to direct the
young idea in its musket-practice, if he is to be denied
the ordinary luxuries of every-day life? If a Platonic exercise
in osculation, occasionally, cannot be connived at,
where are the mitigating circumstances in the dreary life
of a Western schoolmaster? We give it up.”</p>

<h5>KINDLY CAUTION.</h5>

<p>A young fellow in a Western town was fined ten dollars
for kissing a girl against her will, and the following day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
the damsel sent him the amount of his fine, with a note
saying that the next time he kissed her he must be less
rough about it, and be careful to do it when her father
was not around.</p>

<h5>RETALIATION.</h5>

<p>The following colloquy occurred in an English divorce-case.
Mr. Sergeant Tindal, “He treated her very kindly,
did he not?” Atkinson, “Oh, yes, very; he kissed her
several times.” Mr. Sergeant Tindal, “And how did
she treat him?” Atkinson, “Well, she retaliated.”</p>

<h5>AN EXPENSIVE KISS.</h5>

<p>An interesting suit for damages was tried in the Circuit
Court of Sauk County, Wisconsin. The title of the case
was Helen Crager <i>vs.</i> The Chicago and Northwestern
Railroad Company. The facts are substantially as follows.
The plaintiff, who is a good-looking, interesting
young lady, twenty-one years of age, and a school-teacher,
on the 6th of March, 1873, bought a ticket of the company’s
ticket-agent at Reedsburg, for Baraboo, and took a
seat in a passenger-car attached to a mixed train. When
within a few miles of her destination, the plaintiff, being
at the time alone with the conductor (the only other passenger
and an employé of the company having left the
car), was caressed and kissed by the conductor. There
being nothing in the lady’s manner to induce such familiarity,
the ticket-puncher was, soon after the occurrence,
arrested upon a charge of assault and battery. He pleaded
guilty, was fined twenty-five dollars by the justice, and
discharged by the company. The court ruled as a matter
of law that the company was liable for the plaintiff for
actual damage occasioned by the wrongful act of the conductor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
The case was well argued, and submitted to the
jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed
her damages at one thousand dollars.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/line.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<h5>TWENTY SHILLINGS FINE.</h5>

<p>A noteworthy trial may be found among the proceedings
of a Connecticut court held at New Haven, May 1,
1660. In this case, the kisser was Jacob M. Murline,
and the kissee was Miss Sarah Tuttle. It was demonstrated
that Jacob “tooke up or tooke away her gloves. Sarah
desired him to give her the gloves, to which he answered
he would do so if she would give him a kysse, upon which
they sat down together, his arme being about her waiste,
and her arme upon his shoulder or about his neck, and <i>he</i>
kyssed her and <i>she</i> kyssed him, or they kyssed one another,
continuing in this posture about half an hour.”</p>

<p>On examination, the amatory Jacob confusedly admitted
that “he tooke her by the hand, and they both sat down
upon a chest, but whether his arme were about her waiste,
and her arme upon his shoulder or about his neck, he
knows not, for he never thought of it since till Mr. Raymond
told him of it at Mannatos, for which he was
blamed, and told he had not layed it to heart as he
ought.” Jacob and Sarah were each fined twenty shillings.
So much for two centuries ago.</p>

<h5>BREACH OF PROMISE.</h5>

<p>Breach-of-promise trials are of frequent occurrence in
the English courts, and any contribution to the law of
the subject is received with interest. The English papers,
therefore, comment with great relish upon the definition
of a marriage engagement given by Judge Neilson, of
Brooklyn, who, in a suit for money damages for blighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
affections, charged the jury that the “gleam of the eye
and the conjunction of the lips are overtures when they
become frequent and protracted.” In the face of such a
decision he is a rash man who would say, in the words of
the song, “I know an eye both soft and bright,” and
that variety of kiss known as the “lingering” is positively
interdicted to gentlemen who do not mean business,
or who are liable to a change of mind.</p>

<h5>THE INGENUITY OF THIEVES.</h5>

<p>When the Pope’s chamberlain, who was captured by
Italian brigands, paid fifty thousand francs as ransom-money
to the leader of the band, the sight of the money
so transported him that he fell on his knees and begged
to kiss the hand of his captive before he departed. The
prelate stretched out his hand to him, forgetting that he
wore a ring of great value, which the scoundrel, as he
kissed the hand, slyly slipped over the finger and appropriated
to himself.</p>

<p>This incident was more than paralleled by French
dexterity in a case which is thus reported by a Paris correspondent:</p>

<p>There is a pretty little creature who has bestowed upon
herself the cognomen of Diane de Bagatelle, with whom
a well-known young viscount is madly in love. Mlle.
Diane is a very romantic young lady, with a taste for the
plays and novels of the younger Dumas, and especially for
the “Dame aux Camellias.” So she was not surprised
when one day the card of the Count de X——, the father
of the viscount in question, was handed to her, and an
elegant elderly gentleman, faultlessly dressed, and with
the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor at his button-hole,
was ushered into her boudoir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span></p>

<p>“My son loves Mademoiselle,” began the count, without
further preface.</p>

<p>“I know it,” sighed Diane.</p>

<p>“He has——”</p>

<p>“A sister!” exclaimed the lady, remembering the interview
between Marguerite Gautier and the elder Duval.</p>

<p>“No, not a sister, but a cousin,—his cousin Blanche, to
whom he has been betrothed for years. She pines and
weeps, and you, mademoiselle, you and your fatal charms
are the cause.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” sighed Diane, feeling herself Doche and
Blanche Pierson rolled into one and in real earnest.</p>

<p>“Your sensibility does you honor. Will you break
with my son at once and forever? And if two hundred
thousand francs——”</p>

<p>“Two hundred thousand francs!”</p>

<p>“I will draw you a check at once.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” exclaimed the lady, “you have not made appeal
to a callous heart. I will make the sacrifice; I will give
up Henri. You said, I think, two hundred thousand?”</p>

<p>“I did. Blessings on you, my child!” exclaimed the
count, fervently. “Write the letter I shall dictate, and
the check shall be yours.”</p>

<p>So down Diane sat, and penned the following epistle:</p>

<p>“Dear Henri, I love you no more. In fact, I never
have loved you. I love another. Farewell forever.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Diane.</span>”</p>

<p>The count took the letter, inspected it carefully, and
placed it in his pocket-book, from which he then drew a
check for the amount named, which he placed in the
lady’s eager hands.</p>

<p>“Allow me, my child, to raise to my lips the gentle
hand that has just saved my son!” A kiss and a tear fell
on the dainty hand together; it was then released, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
the aged nobleman departed. He had not been long
gone when Mlle. Diane discovered that her diamond
ring, which was valued at ten thousand francs, had disappeared
from her finger; and further investigations proved
that her silverware and other articles of value had also
vanished. The pretended count was no other than a
swindler of the very worst type. The worst of the affair
was that the scamp actually mailed the letter of Mlle.
Diane to the viscount, so that the lady found herself
minus an adorer as well as her valuables.</p>

<h4>THE MEDICAL VIEW.</h4>

<h5>DON’T KISS THE BABY.</h5>

<p>The promiscuous kissing of children is a pestilent practice.
We use the word advisedly, and it is mild for the
occasion. Murderous would be the proper word, did the
kissers know the mischief they do. Yes, madam, <i>murderous</i>;
and we are speaking to you. Do you remember
calling on your dear friend Mrs. Brown the other day,
with a strip of flannel round your neck? And when little
Flora came dancing into the room, didn’t you pounce
upon her demonstratively, call her a precious little pet,
and kiss her? Then you serenely proceeded to describe
the dreadful sore throat that kept you from prayer-meeting
the night before. You had no designs on the dear child’s
life, we know; nevertheless, you killed her! Killed her
as surely as if you had fed her with strychnine or arsenic.
Your caresses were fatal.</p>

<p>Two or three days after, the little pet began to complain
of a sore throat too. The symptoms grew rapidly alarming;
and when the doctor came, the single word <i>diphtheria</i>
sufficed to explain them all. To-day a little mound
in Greenwood is the sole memento of your visit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>Of course the mother does not suspect, and would not
dare to suspect, you of any Instrumentality in her bereavement.
She charges it to a mysterious Providence. The
doctor says nothing to disturb the delusion; that would
be impolitic, if not cruel: but to an outsider he is free to
say that the child’s death was due directly to your infernal
stupidity. Those are precisely the words: more forcible
than elegant, it is true; but who shall say, under the
circumstances, that they are not justifiable? Remember,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Evil is wrought by want of thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As well as by want of heart.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It would be hard to tell how much of the prevalent
sickness and mortality from diphtheria is due to such
want of thought. As a rule, adults have the disease in so
mild a form that they mistake it for a simple cold; and,
as a cold is not contagious, they think nothing of exposing
others to their breath or to the greater danger of
labial contact. Taking into consideration the well-established
fact that diphtheria is usually if not always communicated
by the direct transplanting of the malignant
vegetation which causes the disease, the fact that there
can be no more certain means of bringing the contagion
to its favorite soil than the act of kissing, and the further
fact that the custom of kissing children on all occasions
is all but universal, it is not surprising that, when the disease
is once imported into a community, it is very likely
to become epidemic.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to charge the spread of diphtheria
entirely to the practice of child-kissing. There are other
modes of propagation: though it is hard to conceive of
any more directly suited to the spread of the infection or
more general in its operation. It stands to diphtheria
in about the same relation that promiscuous hand-shaking
formerly did to the itch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span></p>

<p>It were better to avoid the practice. The children
will not suffer if they go unkissed; and their friends
ought for their sake to forego the luxury for a season. A
single kiss has been known to infect a family; and the
most careful may be in condition to communicate the disease
without knowing it. Beware, then, of playing Judas,
and let the babies alone.</p>

<h5>EXCESSIVE GALLANTRY.</h5>

<p>The late Marquis de Prades-Conti, ex-officer of the
body-guard of Charles X., died from the effects of what
might be called an excess of gallantry. He had never
been ill a day, and retained all his activity in spite of his
eighty-two years, but in stooping to kiss the hand of the
Dowager Countess de la Rochepeon, who came to pay
him a visit, he fell dead.</p>

<h3>THE TREACHEROUS SIDE.</h3>

<h4>MADAME DE STAEL’S HYPOCRISY.</h4>

<p>Coleridge was a man of violent prejudices, and had
conceived an insuperable aversion for France, of which
he was not slow to boast. “I hate,” he would say, “the
hollowness of French principles; I hate the republicanism
of French politics; I hate the hostility of the French
people to revealed religion; I hate the artificiality of
French cooking; I hate the acidity of French wines; I
hate the flimsiness of the French language.” He would
inveigh with equal acrimony against the unreality and
immorality of the French character of both sexes, especially
of the women; and in justification of his unmeasured invective,
he related that he was one day sitting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with Madame de Staël in London, when her
man-servant entered the room and asked her if she would
receive Lady Davey. She raised her eyebrows and
shrugged her shoulders, and appeared to shudder with
nausea as she turned to him and said, “Ah, ma foi! ô,
mon cher ami! ayez pitié de moi! Mais quoi faire? Cette
vilaine femme! Comme je la déteste! Elle est, vraiment,
insupportable!” And then, on her entry, she flung
her arms around her, kissed her on both cheeks, pressed
her to her bosom, and told her that she was more than
enchanted to behold her.</p>

<p>But the query arises, have the French a monopoly of
such conventional duplicity? or may we find its counterpart
nearer home?</p>

<h4>A JUDAS KISS.</h4>

<p>This time Sophronia was so much in earnest that she
found it necessary to bend forward in the carriage and
give Bella a kiss. A Judas order of kiss; for she thought,
while she yet pressed Bella’s hand after giving it, “Upon
your own showing, you vain heartless girl, puffed up by
the doting folly of a dustman, I need have no relenting
towards <i>you</i>.”</p>

<h4>A WIFE’S INFIDELITY.</h4>

<p>Heaven support thee, old man! thou hast to pass
through the bitterest trial which honor and affection can
undergo,—household treason! When the wife lifts high
the blushless front, and brazens out her guilt; when the
child, with loud voice, throws off all control, and makes
boast of disobedience, man revolts at the audacity; his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
spirit arms against his wrong; its face, at least, is bare;
the blow, if sacrilegious, is direct. But when mild words
and soft kisses conceal the worst foe Fate can arm,—when
amidst the confidence of the heart starts up the form
of Perfidy,—when out from the reptile swells the fiend in
its terror,—when the breast on which man leaned for
comfort has taken counsel to deceive him,—when he
learns that, day after day, the life entwined with his own
has been a lie and a stage mime,—he feels not the softness
of grief, nor the absorption of rage; it is mightier than
grief, and more withering than rage; it is a horror that
appalls.</p>

<h4>ALGERINE REVENGE.</h4>

<p>A tragic event occurred in a divorce court at Constantine,
in Algeria. The wife of Bel-Kassem appeared before
the Cadi and demanded a divorce from her husband
on the ground that he had ill-treated her. In spite of
the strenuous opposition of the respondent, the Cadi gave
judgment in favor of the lady, who, triumphantly pronouncing
the orthodox formula, “I repudiate thee,”
bounced out of the court. The custom of the country
wills that a defeated suitor kiss the judge upon the
shoulder, to show that he acknowledges the justice of his
sentence. In accordance with this usage, Bel-Kassem, in
apparent submission, moved toward the Cadi. But as he
drew near him his manner suddenly changed. Dashing
aside his burnous, he sprang upon the unfortunate judge
and drove his knife into his breast. The murderer then
threw down his weapon and surrendered himself to the
gendarmes, saying, quietly, “I have killed the Cadi because,
according to the Koran, a judge who gives an
unjust sentence deserves to be put to death.”</p>

<h4>THE KISS FULIGINOUS.</h4>

<p>The Italian poet Francesco Gianni is the author of a
remarkable sonnet, in which the avenging kiss of the
demons for the kiss of treason is given with great power,
following a no less powerful portraiture of Satan:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Poi fra le braccia si reco quel tristo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E con la bocca fumigante e neva</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gli rese il bacio che avea dato al Cristo.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>[Then the malefactor threw himself into his arms, and
with mouth black and smoking—the kiss fuliginous—he
gave back the kiss that he had given to Christ.]</p>

<h4>FABULLA.</h4>

<p>Martial in his “Epigrams” (xii. 93) makes the following
hit:</p>

<p>“Fabulla has found out a way to kiss her lover in the
presence of her husband. She has a little fool whom she
kisses over and over again, when the lover immediately
seizes him while he is still wet with the multitude of kisses,
and sends him back forthwith, charged with his own, to
his smiling mistress. How much greater a fool is the
husband than the professed fool!”</p>

<p>Or, as Hay translates it:</p>

<p>Evidently the poet Gray had in his mind’s eye the
following passage from Lucretius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Non domus accipiet te læta, neque uxor</div>

<p>[No joyous home shall receive thee, nor excellent wife,
nor will any dear children of thine run out to meet thee
and vie with each other in snatching kisses from thee,
and raise a tumult of sweet but unutterable affection in
thy breast.]</p>

<h4>AFTER THE BALL.</h4>

<p>[The sisters return from the ball to their chamber, gayly
laugh and chat over the reminiscences of the night, lay
aside “the robe of satin and Brussels lace,” “comb out
their braids and curls,” and as the fire goes out, and the
winter chill is gathering, they seek repose. “Curtained
away from the chilly night, after the revel is done,” they
“float along in a splendid dream,” which the poet recounts,
and then addresses them thus:]</p>

<h4>“I WANT TO FIND MY PAPA.”</h4>

<p>A lady while walking in a city street met a little girl
between two and three years old, evidently lost, and crying bitterly.
Taking her by the hand, the lady asked her
where she was going.</p>

<p>“I am going down town to find my papa,” was the
reply, between sobs, of the child.</p>

<p>“What is your papa’s name?” asked the lady.</p>

<p>“His name is papa,” replied the innocent little thing.</p>

<p>“But what is his other name?” queried the lady;
“what does your mamma call him?”</p>

<p>“She calls him papa,” persisted the baby.</p>

<p>The lady then took the little one by the hand and led
her along, saying,—</p>

<p>“You had better come with me; I guess you came
from this way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t want to go back; I want to find my
papa,” replied the little girl, crying afresh as if her heart
would break.</p>

<p>“What do you want of your papa?” asked the lady.</p>

<p>“I want to kiss him.”</p>

<p>Just then a sister of the child came along looking for
her and led her away. From subsequent inquiries, it
appeared that the little one’s papa, whom she was so
earnestly in search of, had recently died. In her lonesomeness
and love for him, she tired of waiting for him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
to come home, and had gone to find him and greet him
with the accustomed kiss.</p>

<h4>THE PENALTY OF HARSHNESS.</h4>

<p>It seems a hard and cruel thing to make the affections
of a child its means of punishment for slight juvenile
offences. A sad occurrence may be quoted as evidence
in point.</p>

<p>A little girl, who, although an affectionate little creature
as ever lived, was very volatile and light-hearted, could
not always <i>remember</i> to mind her mother. At the close
of a winter day she had gone into the street, contrary to
her mother’s injunction, to play with one of her little
companions; when she came in, and was prepared to go
to bed, she approached her mother for her good-night
kiss.</p>

<p>“I cannot kiss you to-night, Mary,” said the mother;
“you have been a very naughty little girl, and have disobeyed
me. I cannot kiss you to-night.”</p>

<p>The little girl, her face streaming with tears, again
begged her mother to kiss her; but she was a “strong-minded
woman,” and was inexorable.</p>

<p>It was a sad lesson that she learned, for on that very
night the child died of croup. She had asked her mother,
the last thing as she went up to her little bed, if she would
kiss her in the morning; but in the morning her innocent
lips were cold.</p>

<h4>VIRGINIA.</h4>

<p>Macaulay, in his “Lays of Ancient. Rome,” includes
the tragic incident which led to the downfall of the execrable
government of Appius Claudius, who had made
an attempt upon the chastity of a beautiful young girl of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
humble birth. The decemvir, unable to succeed by bribes
and solicitations, resorted to an outrageous act of tyranny.
A vile dependant of the Claudian house laid claim to the
damsel as his slave. The cause was brought before the
tribunal of Appius. The wicked magistrate, in defiance
of the clearest proofs, gave judgment for the claimant;
but the girl’s father, a brave soldier, saved her from servitude
and dishonor by stabbing her to the heart in the
sight of the whole forum. Virginius, in the course of a
thrilling appeal to the people, says,—</p>

<p>In the book of Deuteronomy, ch. xxxiv. v. 5, occurs
the sentence, “So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died
there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the
Lord.” The literal rendering of the last words is, “by
the <i>mouth</i> of the Lord,” or, as the Hebrews express it,
“with a kiss from the mouth of God.” It is thus paraphrased
by an old English poet:</p>

<p>The first lesson which the infant is taught is to kiss; it
is at once the language of infancy and the currency of
childhood. The little passionless face as it rests upon its
mother’s bosom is moulded into smiles by a kiss, and thus
by love’s fruit sweet echo is produced. Who shall tell
the mystery, the deep love and earnestness, the quiet joy,
the proud hope, of a mother’s kiss? and what brow or
cheek of all that have gone forth into the wide, wide
world, but wears this heavenly jewel, as imperishable as
the glance of a diamond?</p>
